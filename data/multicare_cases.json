    "clinical_text": "A 74-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with symptomatic wide complex tachycardia in the absence of hemodynamic deterioration. On admission, electrocardiography demonstrated monomorphic VT with a right bundle branch block pattern, a Q wave in lead V1, left superior axis deviation, and ventriculoatrial dissociation, suggesting an exit site in the posteromedial papillary muscle region of the left ventricle (Figure 1A). Despite the patient undergoing electrical and pharmacological cardioversions, the VT remained unresponsive. The patient had a history of hypertension with antihypertensive drug use but no history of structural heart disease or tobacco or alcohol use. On the baseline examination, transthoracic echocardiography estimated LV end-diastolic dimension and LV ejection fraction to be 62 mm and 26%, respectively. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) revealed no significant stenotic lesions in the coronary arteries and no structural heart disease (Supplementary Figures 1A,B), indicating tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.\nFollowing admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient underwent a percutaneous left-sided stellate ganglion block with bupivacaine, a cardiac sympathetic intervention suppressing sympathetic activity for controlling VT. However, the cardiac sympathetic intervention was unsuccessful. Given that the VT remained unresolved and the driving cause of electrical instability was unclear, radiofrequency catheter ablation was decided as the most appropriate treatment strategy. Endocardial electroanatomical mapping of the LV using a CARTO-3 system (Biosense Webster) was performed through both transseptal and retroaortic approaches using a multi-electrode catheter. The procedure was performed using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) through a transseptal approach and viewing the LV structure in real-time. The ablation catheter was positioned through the retroaortic approach. During endocardial mapping, intracardiac electrograms showed fractionated potentials around the posteromedial papillary muscle with the earliest activation (-40 ms) (Figures 1B-D). Endocardial bipolar voltage mapping revealed no scarring (0.5-1.5 mV), and the activation map was consistent with an exit site in the posteromedial papillary muscle region. Under direct ICE visualization (Figure 2A), endocardial ablation using an irrigated-tip catheter (SmartTouch, Biosense Webster) and 40 W was applied to target the earliest site that showed the initial Q wave in the unipolar signal with 10-15 g of contact force (Figures 2B,C). During the first ablation, the VT was terminated for 30 s with an inaudible steam pop recorded by ICE (Figure 2D and Supplementary Video 1), and a sudden rise in electrical impedance was not noted. After confirming that no evidence of perforation or tissue defects were present in the first ablation site, multiple circumferential ablations were performed in the area surrounding the posteromedial papillary muscle without further steam pops. Repeated programmed electrical stimulation failed to induce VT following the ablation. Before the end of the procedure, the ICE operator confirmed that there was no evidence of procedure-related complications. The transthoracic echocardiography performed the next day showed no evidence of mitral regurgitation or tissue defects in the ablation sites (Figure 3A).\nAfter 2 months of follow-up, the patient remained free of VT. Echocardiography showed improved LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 50% and a decreased LV size with LV end-diastolic dimension of 52 mm, but a pseudoaneurysm (26 x 9 mm) that has the ratio of the maximum diameter of the orifice to the maximum internal diameter of the cavity was lesser than 0.50 was identified at the base of the LV posteromedial papillary muscle where a steam pop had occurred without pericardial effusion (Figure 3B and Supplementary Video 2). The patient was asymptomatic; therefore, she was referred to the outpatient clinic for observational follow-up during the following year without anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents; the patient underwent no further interventions. One year later, cardiac CT revealed that the pseudoaneurysm that typically has a neck narrower than the diameter of the aneurysm remained present but showed no signs of a size change or other complications such as thrombus formation (Figure 3C).",

    "clinical_text": "In January 2013, a 56-year-old female complained of persistent pain in the upper abdomen and back; this followed a reported 3 months of poor appetite, weight loss, and jaundice. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper abdomen revealed gallbladder lesions. A surgical resection of the gallbladder was conducted on February 28, 2013, after which her jaundice was resolved. Histologically, the lesion was composed of intraductal papillary neoplasms with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia together with some complex fusion and focal carcinoma. With regards to radical surgery, a margin negative resection status (R0-status) was reached and no positive lymph node was found. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with GBC at pT1aN0M0, Stage IA. No further chemotherapy or radiotherapy was given after surgery. On November 23, 2015, an MRI displayed a large mass occupying the gallbladder area and several soft tissue nodules in the lower segment of the common bile duct. The patient then received a palliative operation on December 17, 2015, including a total pancreectomy, splenectomy, subtotal gastrectomy, and partial hepatectomy. The pathology was confirmed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The preoperative serum CA19-9 was 731.30 U/mL (normal range, 0-22 U/mL) on November 24, 2015 (<PMC6856073_fonc-09-01180-g0001_L_1_1.webp>), and then postoperative level decreased to 110.20 U/mL on March 23, 2016. During the 6-month follow-up period from March 2016 to September 2016, the laboratory tests demonstrated a durable increase in the serum CA19-9 level (330.50 U/mL on September 23, 2016). The patient was then administered three lines of chemotherapy regimens due to disease progression or serious adverse events, which included cisplatin plus S-1, gemcitabine plus capecitabine, and irinotecan plus oxaliplatin in sequence (Table 1). During administration of these chemotherapies, new disease progression in the liver and lungs was first confirmed by an upper-abdomen enhanced MRI and chest CT scan in October 2017.\nAfter seven cycles of the last chemotherapy regimen, the enhanced total abdominal CT scan on September 1, 2018, revealed a 7.8 x 6.9 cm mass located in the original gallbladder area (or the anastomotic stoma), accompanied by abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis (Figures 2A1-A4). Meanwhile, the patient's serum CA19-9 level markedly elevated to >1000.00 U/ml. Accordingly, the efficacy was evaluated as systemic progression. After receiving written informed consent, we changed the regimen to apatinib at a dose of 500 mg qd in September 2018. Confirmed partial response (PR) was observed during CT and MRI re-examination within 2 months (November 16, 2018), with impressive reductions in both the numbers and size of the abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph node as well as the mass located in the anastomotic stoma, which shrunk to 5.2 x 3.1 cm (Figures 2B1-B4). Meanwhile, the density of the pulmonary metastases had considerably decreased with cavity formation. The levels of serum 19-9 significantly lowered to 40.60 U/ml. On February 20, 2019, the mass mentioned had reduced and vanished completely according to the diagnostic MRI (Figures 2C1-C4), and this was coupled with a normal level of serum 19-9. The patient experienced some side effects during treatment with apatinib, but no serious adverse events occurred. Anorexia (grade 1), fatigue (grade 1), and diarrhea (grade 2) were observed after 1 week of medication. Montmorillonite powder (3 g tid) was thus prescribed as indicated for the control and symptomatic relief of acute non-specific diarrhea. Hand-foot skin reaction and hypertension occurred after the first week of medication and aggravated to grade 2 after 2 weeks, which led to a 1-week suspension period of apatinib administration. The dose of apatinib was then reduced to 500 mg/d, and a 7-day treatment cycle of 5 days on followed by 2 days off was repeated. Hypertension normalized within 2 weeks following the administration of a combination of amlodipine (5 mg bid) and valsartan (40 mg bid). Meanwhile, the hand-foot skin reaction was also well-controlled after applying a fragrance-free cream that contains urea to keep hands and feet well-moisturized. No proteinuria, occult blood of feces, or decline in leucocyte count occurred. Although the levels of serum CA19-9 were slightly increased, the efficacy of PR was sustained for more than 10 months until the last reexamination (September 19, 2019), and this has since continued (Figures 2D1-D4,E1-E4). By the end of September 23, 2019, the administration of apatinib as single agent for maintenance therapy was continued and the duration of treatment reached almost 1 year with a satisfactory quality of life.",

The patient achieved complete remission following inducted chemotherapy with retinoic acid (45 mg/m2, days 1-28). Following a total of 8 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with the MA regimen, the patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in January, 2006.\nIn November 2006, the patient was admitted to the Department of Oncology (Jinhua Central Hospital, Jinhua, China) due to a painless palpable mass in the left breast that had been present for 10 days. The patient exhibited no other symptoms and had no relevant previous or family histories. A physical examination revealed a mass measuring 2.0x1.5 cm in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast. Ultrasound revealed a solid and hypoechoic mass, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) identified the mass as a fibroma. No suspicious lesions were located in the patient's lungs by chest radiography or in the liver by ultrasound.\nThe complete blood count showed a WBC count of 2.9x109/l with 53.4% neutrocytes, a red blood cell count of 1.94x1012/l with 72.0% HCT and a PLT count of 27x109/l. Since the mass was diagnosed as a benign tumor by FNA, the patient underwent a lumpectomy under local infiltration anesthesia, despite having a low PLT count. The tumor was removed in November, 2006, and the pathological results revealed that the structure of the breast, which had been invaded by middle-sized diffuse lymphoid cells and fat tissue, was destroyed (<PMC3861586_OL-07-01-0145-g01_A_1_2.webp>). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the markers of MPO and LCA were positive and that those for CD68, CD79a and L26 were negative (<PMC3861586_OL-07-01-0145-g01_B_2_2.webp>). Following confirmation by histopathology, the patient was diagnosed with GS of the breast. The tests for liver function, performed in February, 2007, demonstrated that the levels for alanine aminotranferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and r-glutamyltransfarase were 97 IU/l, 186 IU/l, 90.7 mumol/l, 40.8 mumol/l and 1,064 U/l, respectively, with normal reference values of 0-40 IU/l, 0-40 IU/l, 2-25 mumol/l, 0-8 mumol/l and 0-50 U/l, respectively. The level of the immunoglobulin IgG protein subtype was 4,240 mg/ml (normal reference value, 723-1,685 mg/ml). The patient was diagnosed with graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and received immunosuppression therapy to protect the liver. However, the effect of the treatment was unsatisfactory and the patient succumbed to fungal pneumonia in June, 2007, without having received systemic chemotherapy or a second bone marrow transplantation. The relapse of the GS in the patient's breasts was not identified prior to mortality.",

    "description": "A 20-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia presented with treatment-refractory psychotic symptoms and medication adverse effects, ultimately diagnosed with Fahr's disease confirmed by neuroimaging showing bilateral basal ganglia calcifications and genetic testing revealing an SLC20SA gene deficit.",
    "clinical_text": "The 20-year-old unmarried male, diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17, was hospitalized due to psychotic manifestations, characterized by auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, disorganized thoughts, and violent behaviors with no history of mental, genetic, or neurological disorders. Additionally, the patient had neither family history of similar complaints nor documented history of Parkinsonism, infectious etiologies, or substance abuse at the time of initial diagnosis. The patient maintained modest academic performance during the period spanning from 17 to 19 years while experiencing mild auditory hallucination and paranoid ideation, managed with a regimen of Paliperidone at a dosage of 3mg per day. However, a relapse of psychotic symptoms occurred following the discontinuation of medication without medical consultation, prompting the subsequent adjustments in treatment modalities. Initially, Paliperidone at 3mg daily for one month yielded a suboptimal response, leading to the transition to a combination regimen comprising Aripiprazole at 10mg daily alongside Biperiden at 2mg daily, commenced two months preceding the current admission. Moreover, Fluoxetine at 10mg daily was introduced 1.5 months before the admission, because of compulsive hand washing. Further alterations in pharmacotherapy included the incorporation of Risperidone oral solution at 1mg daily for one month, in conjunction with Flupentixol Decanoate at 20mg administered once biweekly. Upon admission, the patient was receiving Aripiprazole at 10mg daily, Fluoxetine at 10mg daily, Risperidone at 2mg daily, Flupentixol Decanoate at 20mg biweekly, and Biperiden at 2mg daily. Despite the multifaceted pharmacological approach, symptomatic relief remained elusive, with concurrent escalation of aggressive behaviors.\nThroughout his hospitalization, the patient exhibited concealed left-side weakness and mild muscle rigidity. He maintained a stable gait and independent activities of daily living. Neurological examinations and physical examinations showed negative findings except for the aforementioned. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed calcifications in the bilateral globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, thalami, and subcortical areas, with no evident vessel abnormalities ( <PMC11148442_fpsyt-15-1391607-g001_A_1_4.webp><PMC11148442_fpsyt-15-1391607-g001_B_2_4.webp><PMC11148442_fpsyt-15-1391607-g001_C_3_4.webp><PMC11148442_fpsyt-15-1391607-g001_D_4_4.webp> ). Notably, the patient displayed marked aggression and hostility and exhibited pronounced susceptibility to medication-related adverse effects, such as restlessness and Parkinsonism. To optimize therapeutic efficacy while mitigating risks, the medication regimen was transitioned from Aripiprazole (5-10mg/day) to Olanzapine (7.5mg/day; administered for a total of 18 days), and ultimately to Risperidone (1mg/day). The patient's blood investigations including ceruloplasmin, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, thyroid and parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase showed no abnormalities. Therefore, given the poor response to the patient's psychotic and aggressive behaviors, and high susceptibility to psychotropic adverse effects, with supportive brain CT and MRI findings, a diagnosis of Fahr's disease was considered. The revised diagnosis was further confirmed by genetic testing unveiling a deficit in the SLC20SA gene. Following four weeks of treatment adjustment, the patient was stabilized on a regimen comprising Risperidone 1.5mg/day, Valproic acid 1500mg/day, and Quetiapine 37.5mg/day. Upon discharge from the psychiatric acute ward, the patient had mild psychotic symptoms devoid of disruptive behaviors or violence. His Cognitive Ability Screening Inventory (CASI) score, which might be underestimated because of psychotic symptoms, was 75/100. The component scores of CASI were as follows: Short-term memory: 9/12, Long-term memory: 7/10, Attention: 3/8, Mental manipulation and concentration: 8/10, Orientation: 18/18, Abstract thinking and judgment: 6/12, Language: 8/10, Visual construction and drawing: 10/10, and Fluency: 6/10.\nFrom the patient's perspective, as assessed through the Health, Personality, and Habit Test -A Form Scale, he continued to harbor beliefs that he was being followed, spied on, and subjected to potential harm or attack. He perceived a sense of loss of autonomy, with the conviction that others had control over his body and were privy to his thoughts. Despite recognizing the severity and progressive nature of his mental disorder, he expressed feelings of frustration and sadness regarding his experiences. Acknowledging the necessity for long-term treatment, the patient consented to transfer to a psychiatric chronic ward to facilitate disease management and rehabilitation.",

He denied having fever, chills, dysphagia, odynophagia, acid reflux, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, recent weight loss, polyuria, polyphagia, polydipsia, or dysuria. In the ED, the patient appeared confused but followed verbal commands. The initial vital signs were notable for elevated blood pressure (140/72 mm Hg), tachycardia (125 beats per minute), and tachypnea (28 breaths per minute). On further examination, the patient was alert and oriented to self and place only. There was no facial asymmetry or tongue laceration, and the pupils were dilated but reactive to light and accommodation. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nTriage blood tests were significant for hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated serum lipase, and leukocytosis (Table 1). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactic acid. Additional tests revealed moderate ketones with an anion gap of 27.5. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate but no acute ischemic pattern. The patient was treated for hyperkalemia and admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for the management of DKA. The heart rhythm converted to sinus rhythm after 10 mg of dose of IV diltiazem and 150 mg of amiodarone. The patient was managed with a DKA protocol comprising insulin infusions, IV fluids, and electrolyte fluid solutions.\nThe patient's ICU course was complicated by melena and acute blood loss anemia, necessitating a gastroenterology consultation. Bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed diffuse esophageal plaques concerning for candidiasis, ulcerated esophageal necrosis, and a small hiatal hernia (Figure 1). The histopathology of random esophageal biopsies revealed necroinflammatory material and ulcer debris associated with abundant fungal microorganisms, which were morphologically compatible with Candida species. Overall, the findings were consistent with AEN in the setting of DKA and Candida esophagitis. Immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2) was negative. The patient received supportive care with buprenorphine, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), carafate suspension, fluconazole, IV fluids, and insulin infusion. A relook endoscopy after 6 months showed normal esophageal mucosa (Figure 2).",

Physical examination on admission revealed central cyanosis and digital clubbing with resting pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 60% (normal range > 95%) on room air. Blood investigations showed an elevated hemoglobin level of 15.5 g/L (normal range: 11.5-15 g/L) and a normal liver enzyme profile with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 32 U/L (normal range: 17-59 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 19 U/L (normal range: 21-72 U/L). He had an elevated serum ammonia level of 77 mumol/L (normal range: 7-30 mumol/L) but no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy was found.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) was unremarkable. Echocardiography revealed features of mild left-sided volume overload and dilated left atrium, after that, a contrast echocardiography was performed with agitated saline, which showed the appearance of micro-bubbles in the left atrium after four cardiac cycles, suggesting pulmonary arteriovenous communication.\nDoppler ultrasound showed dilated extrahepatic main PV with hypoplastic intrahepatic portal venous branches arising from the dilated segment and a large communicating shunt between IVC and the main PV (Figure 1B). Computed tomography (CT) angiography confirmed the Doppler findings and a diagnosis of type II Abernethy malformation was made (Figure 1C). Hepatic veins were normal on Doppler and CT angiography. Once the diagnosis was made, the patient was counseled regarding the treatment option.\nThe patient was taken under general anesthesia for endovascular embolization of CPSS. Both jugular and femoral access were taken. The shunt was cannulated from both sides (jugular and femoral). Multiple catheter angiograms were taken to establish the patency of the intrahepatic portal venous branches (Figure 2A). After documenting the patency of intrahepatic portal venous branches, the decision of shunt closure was taken. Angiogram showed the diameter of the shunt as 12 mm with the length of the shunt being 7 mm. After proper evaluation, the decision was taken to close the shunt with a vascular plug closure device (Cera, LifeTech Scientific Corporation, Shenzhen, China). The device was deployed across the shunt via the femoral route and angiograms were taken from the jugular route, which showed a visualization of the intrahepatic portal branches and immediate closure of the shunt (Figure 2B).",

Case No. 3 and 6 were diagnosed with unexplained infertility with at least two episodes of early embryonic failures after ART, while case No. 5 was affected by tubal factors. In case 3, upon the first episode, when hCG declined from 43,271 to 43,185, the patient had concurrent minor vaginal bleeds, indicating a threatened miscarriage. She received 1g tranexamic acid twice daily and a single dose of adalimumab (40mg) for one day and the bleeds stopped. A further decline on Day 55 prompted a second off-label use of adalimumab. Six days after injection, the serum hCG level went back on track (hCG declined from 62,164 on Day 53 to 58,786 on Day 55, then climbed to 120,006 mIU/mL on Day 61). In contrast, case No.6 received only one dose of adalimumab despite having experienced two episodes of early declines of hCG. Case No. 5 had only experienced one episode of hCG early decline and received one single dose of adalimumab on that day. She is now 33wks and is followed up regularly in the antenatal clinic and no stillbirth or any other adverse fetal or maternal outcome has been reported.\nAmong the seven patients who were conceptualized naturally, case No. 9 and 10 had two and four previous spontaneous miscarriages, respectively. Case No. 2 and 7 had a successful obstetric history before the current pregnancy. Case No. 8 was not complicated with pre-existing maternal medical conditions, nor did she have a previous history of miscarriage. However, she suffered from a long-lasting early decrease of hCG for more than ten days, suggesting an adverse embryonic outcome. A similar case was observed in No. 4, who is now 31wks, after being offered a single dose of certolizumab pegol (200mg) at 7wks when hCG fell from 58,016 to 54,438 mIU/mL the following day.\nEight out of the ten women have delivered so far. The average birth weight was 3377.50g (2780-3850g), which fell into the normal reference range. Despite uneventful pregnancies after the rescue therapy, we identified a disproportionally high cesarean section rate in the study group. Case No. 8 is the only one so far who has delivered vaginally. Case No. 3 and 6 had cesarean for fetal distress in labor, possibly resulted from oligohydramnios (not an absolute indication for cesarean but could lead to increased emergency cesarean delivery in labor). Case No. 2 and 7 had CS (C-sections) indicated for previous CS delivery, a major obstetric indication in China. The other three cases had requested a cesarean delivery (also known as CDMR, cesarean delivery on maternal request) in spite of any obstetric indications. This partly reflects China's high rate of CS in the low obstetric risk population.",

The uptake was persistent even in post-void imaging done after adequate hydration, giving us a clue that it was not due to tracer hold up in the ureter.

The differential diagnosis at this juncture included scalp cellulitis/folliculitis, allergic reaction to an insect bite, a foreign body, an evolving scalp abscess or furunculosis, an infected or ruptured sebaceous cyst, or neoplasm. \nThe patient was placed on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875 mg/125 mg oral tablet twice a day and cetirizine 10 mg oral tablet once a day for seven days. Failing to improve in one week, he was scheduled at an ambulatory surgery center to excise and repair a complex scalp wound under a local anesthetic 10 days after being originally seen. In the operating room, the area was sterilely prepped and infiltrated with local anesthesia, and a 1.5 cm x 0.5 cm ellipse of the scalp, including the furuncle, was incised with a scalpel. Upon dissecting around the scalp ellipse, it was determined that a moving, insect-like structure or maggot was within the subcutaneous tissue, attached to the furuncle, as shown in Figure 2. Careful dissection around the larva was performed, and it was removed in its entirety, alive, with some surrounding scalp tissue. \nThe live parasite, as shown in Figure 3, was then photographed intraoperatively using a smartphone and Google Lens AI (Google LLC, Mountain View, United States), which immediately suggested the specimen was likely a larva of Dermatobia hominis. Google Lens is an AI image recognition software based on a neural network (the underlying technology in deep learning and AI), and it is ubiquitously present on mobile phones worldwide. In this case, it was accurate and easily verifiable due to the multitude of provided sources and comparable images. Dozens of similar photographs were presented with this AI-driven search, along with videos of live larvae extracted from their human hosts. Google AI was then used to rapidly gather peer-reviewed case reports of similar surgical extractions and safe curative therapies. The wound was debrided, copiously irrigated, and closed with a 4.0 synthetic, non-absorbable, monofilament suture. Postoperatively, the patient was informed of the suspected identity of the parasite and was reassured that the literature indicated no lasting effects. The larva was sent for pathological examination, which confirmed the identification of D. hominis larva nine days later. The incision healed without complications.",

    "clinical_text": "Patient at the time of appointment in fertility clinic was 31 years old, healthy individual. His partner was 27 years old woman with one missed pregnancy at week 6 in anamnesis. All tested hormonal and biochemical markers - prolactin, vitamin D, testosterone, T4 and TSH : were in normal range. Semen analysis did not show significant changes in volume, concentration and sperm motility. The count of the round cells:1mil/ml, did not exceed reference levels of normal criteria. Percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa was slightly deteriorated : 4% cells with normal morphology, amorphous sperm heads, altered acrosomal distribution and enlarged necks. Sperm DNA fragmentation test did not show increased sperm DNA damage, fragmented DNA occurred in 13% of cells by HaloKit test (<16% DNA fragmentation is associated with normal fertility level). The patient was referred for AZF microdeletion testing after karyotype analysis, which revealed normal 46, XY karyotype, but showed slightly decreased levels of constitutive heterochromatin in the long arm of chromosome Y.\nGenomic DNA was extracted, using Magpurix Blood DNA Extraction Kit 200, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Analysis of AZF region deletions was performed using AZF System Y-chromosome (Sacace) reagents' kit. This Real Time PCR test is based on the amplification of two, specific, nonpolymorphic STS locuses in each region of Y chromosome - AZFa, AZFb and AZFc. The STS locuses used in this kit for detection of AZF regions deletions are: AZFa: sY84, sY86, AZFb: sY127, sY134, AZFc: sY254, sY255, as recommended in the guidelines of American and European Andrology societies (ref...). The sensitivity of this method is >95%.\nAnalyzing patient's DNA, amplification of STS markers AZFa: sY86, AZFb: sY127, sY134, AZFc: sY254, sY255, were detected, so these regions are all present in patient's genome. Amplification product of AZFa: sY84 was absent, and deletion of AZFa regions' STS sY84 was confirmed by repeated analysis.\nAs full deletion of AZFa region is linked with severely impaired spermatogenesis, but patient had normal semen analysis with only slight deviations, more detailed analysis of AZFa region was performed.\nTo exclude SNP in region of primer binding sites of sY84, PCR with redesigned primers and subsequent capillary electrophoresis were performed. Primers were as described previously, PCR conditions are available under request (Table 1,). Normal control DNA from male without AZFa deletion, had amplification product and sequence of AZFa region was obtained, but patients' DNA did not amplify PCR product and sequencing was not possible. Therefore, it was concluded, that patient has deletion in AZFa region.\nFor determining the size of deletion, markers and PCR primers, specific for distinct locations in AZFa region, were found, using MSY Breakpoint Mapper (Table 1,). This database of sequence-tagged sites (STSs) gives a possibility for more precise mapping of deletions in the male-specific region of the human Y chromosome.\nPCR assays for all markers to determine the approximate size of deletion and involved genes (Table 1) were performed, using nuclease free water, 10x PCR buffer (20 mM MgCl2), 10 mM dNTP, betaine, 10 nM primer mixes and 1U/microl Taq polymerase. PCR conditions are available under request.\nAnalysis of patients' father DNA was performed to investigate, whether the AZFa deletion is passed from father to son.\nDeletion of both Y chromosomes' STSs sY84 and sY1323 was detected in patients' (Figure 1, lanes 1-7) and his father DNA samples (lanes 9-16), when compared to positive control (healthy male DNA) (lanes 18-24), confirming the inheritance of this region's deletion. None of markers were visualized from DNA of infertile male with full AZFa region deletion (lanes 26-32).\nThe deletion spans sY84 and sY1323 markers, removing part of one of the AZFa region gene USP9Y and leaving second AZFa gene DDX3Y intact (Figure 2). AZFa partial microdeletion was detected, removing part of AZFa non-coding region and 5' part of USP9Y gene, as testing USP9Y deletion with STS markers in both ends of the gene, sY1323 and USP9Y-44, showed, that 3' marker USP9Y-44 was present. Moreover, STS sY84 : a marker upstream the USP9Y, and sY1323 : a marker in 5' start of the gene, were absent, and this result confirms partial AZFa and USP9Y deletion. Exact breakpoints were not mapped, and sequencing of full AZFa region was not performed due to technical issues. Also, the deletion was already proven with marker testing, and it was not necessary to do full AZFa region investigation. As results of marker testing was the same for father of patient, we proved germline transmission of deletion from father to son and excluded de novo event.",

No cutaneous pigmentations on the face, no limitations of mouth opening, and no enlarged submandibular lymph nodes were noticed.\nIntraoral examination displayed expansion of the buccal cortical plate, extending from the mandibular left incisal to the first molar, and the first deciduous molar was absent (Figure 1(b)). On palpation, it was hard in constancy, fixed, with no signs of mucosal inflammation observed and no signs of paresthesia.\nA panoramic radiograph exposed the loss of trabecular structure and a radiopaque image showing a \"ground-glass\" feature was observed on the left side of the mandible englobing the dental germ of the permanent second premolar (Figure 1(c)).\nThe cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) axial images revealed a radiopacity lesion with an expansion and thinning of the buccal bone cortical with well-defined borders (Figure 1(d)). The dental germ was in the middle of the lesion (Figure 1(e)), and the para-axial images showed the mandibular canal displaced buccally and toward the lower border of the mandible (Figure 1(f)).\nBased on the evaluation of the clinical and radiological data, a provisional diagnosis of FD was made, and differential diagnoses of MAS, MS, and hyperparathyroidism were considered.\nAs the germ needed to be removed, we discussed with the parents the surgical procedure required to extract the germ along with the need for an osteoplasty to remove the excess bone and a biopsy to be taken during the procedure.\nUnder locoregional analgesia, a conservative surgical excision of the buccal bone was proceeded, with extraction of the dental germ and remodeling of the region disturbed by the asymmetry (Figure 2(a)). Macroscopically, the excised bone was soft with spongy aspects (Figure 2(b)). The histological results were consistent with FD. The hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed irregularly shaped trabeculae of immature bone within proliferating fibroblastic and vascularized stroma (Figure 2(c)).\nThe patient was advised to consult his pediatrician for further clinical and radiological investigations. All the laboratory tests and radiological images were in favor of localized FD mandibular lesions.\nThe patient was followed up yearly, both clinically and radiologically with a panoramic radiograph (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)).\nTen years later, the patient complained of left mandibular asymmetry (Figure 3(a)).\nClinical examination revealed a lingual cortical bone expansion beside the buccal one (Figures 3(b) and 3(c)).\nPanoramic X-ray showed the same image of a radiopaque area with the appearance of ground glass aspects in the left hemimandible (Figure 3(d)).\nThe axial images of the CBCT presented a discontinuity of the buccal cortex, expansion of the lingual one, and expansion of the lesion anteriorly to the middle line of the mandible.\nThe mandibular canal was still displaced to the lower border of the mandible (Figure 3(e)).\nA 3D reconstruction showed an increase in the volume of the left hemimandible, confirming mandibular asymmetry (Figure 3(f)).\nAfter discussing the findings with the patient, a second surgery was decided. Under locoregional analgesia, a wide osteoplasty was performed, and the buccal bone was reshaped until the limit of the mental nerve anteriorly and the position of the mandibular canal apically (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). The histology results confirmed the previous one.\nNo complications were recorded in the follow-up period, and the patient was satisfied with the esthetic results (Figure 4(c)).\nFive years later the clinical and radiological exams showed a stabilization of the lesion (Figures 4(d)-4(f)).",

Four lesions (excluding the small lesion distal to tooth 36) were enucleated and sent for histopathological examination. The small cystic lesion distal to tooth 36 was kept under observation. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged the next day and is presently being kept under observation with regular follow ups at the interval of 3 months are being conducted.\nThe histopathologic report revealed that three out of four lesions were OKC and the other lesion which was associated with the impacted canine in the maxillary right quadrant was dentigerous cyst. Cystic lining of all three Keratocystic lesions was parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium of uniform 6-8-cell thickness. The lining epithelium consisted of well-defined columnar basal cells in a palisade arrangement and with polarized nuclei. The height of the epithelial cells and the number of nuclei they contained were reduced. Satellite cysts and epithelial remnants were observed in the connective tissue capsule.",

The patient was referred on account of eclampsia, acute kidney injury, and HELLP syndrome at 33 weeks gestation.\nThe patient presented there with complaints of epigastric pain and blurred vision of a day's duration.\nShe was apparently well until a day prior to presentation when she had the above complaints, which became associated with tonic clinic seizures at home with tongue bite; hence, she was rushed to the hospital. At the hospital, she had another episode of tonic clinic seizures. She was stabilized and referred to KATH for further management. The patient was given antihypertensives and anticonvulsant before referral.\nAt KATH, the blood pressure was high with proteinuria of 3+; however, the SpO2 was 99% on room air. She looked very unwell, pale, and not jaundiced with good hydration. Her chest was clinically clear. She had epigastric pain. Symphysis-fundal height of 32 cm was consistent with the gestational age. Lie was longitudinal, and presentation was cephalic. Fetal heartbeat was present and normal. No contractions were felt. On pelvic examination, the vulva and vagina looked healthy. The cervical os was closed, and the cervix was 2 cm long, firm, and posterior. The patient had 500 mL of cola-like urine and bedside clotting of 15 min. Impression of eclampsia with HELLP syndrome with an unfavorable cervix was made. The patient had samples taken for FBC, BUE, creatinine, serum uric acid, and grouping and crossmatch for 4 units of whole blood and 8 units of FFP. She was then prepared for emergency CS after the bedside clotting was corrected with transfusion of 3 FFPs. Immediately postop, the patient was very stable with normal vital parameters. 4 h post-CS, the patient had abdominal distension was tympanic, severally pale, and jaundiced. The uterus was well contracted, and shifting dullness was negative. Her pulse was 116 with blood pressure of 164/112 mmHg.\nThe patient had made 30 mL of cola-like urine in 4 hours. No bleeding per vaginam was noted. She was continued with the haemotransfusion and the FFP, but unfortunately, her condition did not improve and she ceased breathing. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted for over 30 min but was unsuccessful; hence, she was declared dead. Her labs came later, and liver indices were all markedly raised.",

She was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast cancer and had undergone mastectomy on December 3, 2015. The immunohistochemistry indicated estrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (PR-), HER-2(3+), and Ki-67 (approximately 50% +). She was first diagnosed with chest wall metastasis of BC in April 2018 and had received multiple regimens previously, including anthracyclines, paclitaxel-based chemotherapeutics, and trastuzumab ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). On admission, the patient appeared to be in a good clinical condition, and the performance status (PS) was 1. She had no smoking and drinking habits and no other chronic diseases. The physical examination results showed painless hard nodules, accompanied by redness and swelling, on the left chest wall around the incision made for radical breast cancer surgery ( Figure 1A ). The results of a further examination including CT and MRI showed that she had no metastasis to other organs. We removed a mass from her left chest wall for histopathological examination and found that her breast cancer had metastases to the chest wall ( Figure 1D ). And the immunohistochemical results revealed positive staining for HER2 ( Figure 1E ). We performed genetic testing and found that she had copy number amplification of ERBB2 (8.4-fold higher than normal), a p.R342 non-significant mutation in exon 10 of TP53 (abundance, 46.9%), and PIK3CA exon 1 p.E110del mutation (28.7%, abundance). Based on the clinical history, pathological findings, and Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN) (V2019.1), we confirmed that she had a stage IV breast cancer with possible cross-resistance to pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1). We formulated the \"pyrotinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab\" program for her, and started her treatment on March 16, 2019. She was discharged from the hospital on March 19, 2019 and took oral medication at home as planned. She returned to the hospital on April 4, 2019 to prepare for further treatment. Then, we found that the red and swollen area on her chest wall had completely disappeared ( Figure 1B ). Her cancer cells remained active but could always be inhibited, so the scab of her left chest wall continued to fall off and regenerate ( Figure 1C ). Her last follow-up was November 17, 2021, by which point the disease control time had reached 20 months.",

He denied a history of significant health and psychiatric conditions and denied a family history of psychosis. He endorsed prior cannabis use, denied a history of any significant adverse effects associated with prior use, and he disclosed that 6 years had passed since he last used cannabis. He reported weekly use of alcohol and caffeine and denied use of nicotine/tobacco products and illicit drugs. He endorsed use of over-the-counter medication as needed for seasonal allergies. During the first three study sessions, he smoked cannabis that contained 0, 10, or 25 mg THC through hand-held pipe. Dose-related subjective drug effects, cardiovascular effects, and impairment on cognitive performance assessments were observed as expected. On the fourth experimental session (as with other experimental sessions), baseline assessments were within normal limits and urine drug screening (for common drugs of abuse) and breath alcohol tests were negative. After consuming a standard low-fat breakfast, the participant self-administered vaporized cannabis that contained 25 mg THC within 10 min (per protocol). Acute drug effects escalated in magnitude for the first 20 min following inhalation. He had difficulty responding to staff inquiries, was unable to complete self-report questionnaires, had difficulty keeping his head up, and appeared to periodically fall asleep or lose consciousness despite encouragement by research staff to stay awake and continue. He was unable to maintain a balanced, steady gait when he walked.\nH.C. displayed behavior consistent with heavy sedation. The volunteer had difficulty maintaining consciousness and, at times, would not respond to verbal inquiries by study staff. He was under direct supervision of medical staff and neither his vital signs nor his behavior required medical intervention. He was able to complete a self-reported drug effect questionnaire, but had extreme difficulty completing cognitive performance assessments in the first 90 min following drug exposure. When he did speak, he reported feeling faint, dizzy, nauseated and that he was experiencing tingling sensations in his arms and legs and pain at the base of his neck.\nQuantitative analysis (LC/MS/MS) of whole blood collected 10 min after the completion of cannabis administration (peak level measured in this study) showed 16 ng/mL THC, 3 ng/mL 11-OH-THC, and 17 ng/mL THC-COOH for H.C. These are consistent with mean values (14 ng/mL THC, 2 ng/mL 11-OH-THC, and 7 ng/mL THC-COOH) observed for all participants in this study at that time point and dose of vaporized cannabis. Analysis of whole blood collected 10 min after the completion of cannabis administration in the smoked condition for the same dose level for H.C. (25 mg THC) showed 1 ng/mL THC, 1 ng/mL 11-OH-THC, and 4 ng/mL THC-COOH, and these values are consistent with mean values observed for all participants in this study at that time point and dose of smoked cannabis.\nThree hours after drug administration, his symptoms began to decrease in severity. He indicated that he had experienced a dissociative state and altered perceptions of auditory and visual stimuli at the time of peak drug effect. He reported a hypersensitivity to voices at that time, which he described as if he was more aware of conversations around him, but was unable to hear or understand distinct words. He described visual distortions in the form of the environment and floor sinking away and the appearance of patterns moving on the carpet and chairs in the room. Additionally, he reported an \"out-of-body\" experience characterized by the feeling of being removed from his body, existing above it in space, and feeling that his surroundings were sinking away from him, which was also accompanied by a feeling of paralysis. He reported having had a similar experience when administered ketamine before surgery for a broken leg. Four hours after drug administration, and after eating lunch, H.C.'s symptoms of nausea, faintness, dissociation, and auditory, visual, and perceptual alterations had almost completely subsided. Five hours after drug administration, he appeared more alert and was able to complete all study-related tasks.\nAt the end of the experimental session, H.C. was prompted to recount his experience. He reported feeling overwhelmed that it was an uncomfortable, scary, and unpleasant experience akin to what he would expect an overdose or anxiety attack may feel like, and he indicated he never wanted to have the experience again. He expressed the sense that he thought he would \"never come out of this\" and that he would always feel the adverse effects. Within 8 h of acute drug administration, measures of cognitive performance, subjective mood and drug effects assessments, and vital signs had returned to baseline levels. The study medical team determined that there was no significant health risk with continued study participation and H.C. completed two remaining experimental sessions (lower dose and placebo cannabis) without significant discomfort.",

There was no significant past medical, family, or psychosocial history. There was no history of upper gastrointestinal bleed, or past medical or surgical interventions. On physical examination, he had mild pallor with ill-defined painless swelling in his gastric region. There was no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done which was suggestive of a submucosal lesion in his stomach. Our gastroenterologist thought of GIST; leiomyoma and even gastric malignancy was also suspected because of the patient's old age. A subsequent biopsy was taken which revealed only mucosal tissue. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's abdomen showed an ovoid homogenous 4x3x2 cm mass at the greater curvature of his stomach. There was no other lesion in his whole body. We finally suspected submucosal tumor with the possibility of GIST. Considering the large size of the tumor, location, difficulty of establishing a definite preoperative diagnosis in spite of incision biopsy, suspicion of malignant GIST/tumor, old age and to prevent possible complications such as bleeding or pyloric stenosis, surgical intervention was planned and a subtotal gastrectomy was done. The surgical specimen was received in the department of pathology. On gross examination, an intramural, nodular, solid mass measuring 4x3x2 cm was seen. A cut section revealed whorling trabeculation. Histological observations showed a cellular tumor present in the submucosa, which extended into his muscularis propria. The overlying mucosa was unremarkable. Sections from the tumor showed interlacing bundles of spindle cells which had elongated nuclei, ill-defined cytoplasmic borders and palisading nuclei. Mild nuclear atypia was noted. These cells were separated by collagenous strands. Mitotic activity 5/50 high-power fields were seen; however, no necrosis/atypical mitosis were identified (Fig. 1). There was no lymph node involvement and the surgical margin was negative for tumor cells. A histological diagnosis of a benign mesenchymal tumor was made. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was strongly positive for vimentin and S-100 (<PMC4714491_13256_2015_788_Fig2_HTML_a_1_2.webp>), whereas c-Kit (<PMC4714491_13256_2015_788_Fig2_HTML_b_2_2.webp>), SMA and cytokeratin (CK) were negative.

    "clinical_text": "The patient was a 72-year-old man diagnosed with stage IIIB cT4N2-3M0 squamous subtype NSCLC in March 2021. As to physical examination on presentation to the hospital, the patient's body temperature was 36.2 C, blood pressure was 109/68 mmHg, pulse was 89 beats/min, heart rate was 89 beats/min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and body mass index (BMI) was 20.5 kg/m2. The Karnofsky score was 90. His past medical issues included appendectomy (9 years ago), cataract phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in both eyes (5 years ago), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed in March 2021, treated with linagliptin, 5 mg po, qd and acarbose 50 mg, po, tid). He had no relevant previous comorbidities, and no previous history of liver disease, hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or smoking. Meanwhile, there was no medical history of autoimmune diseases and endocrinopathies. The positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed that irregular soft tissue masses (approximately 8.7 x 6.0 x 7.7 cm) in the dorsal segment of the left upper lobe and lower lobe of the left lung are lobulated, growing across the interlobular fissures, local bronchial occlusion, and abnormally increased standard uptake value (SUV) activity, which is consistent with lung cancer manifestations ( Figures 1A, B ). Some of the left hilar lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes and right hilar lymph nodes displayed increased SUV activity. Metastatic lesions in the other organs or systems were not observed. The bronchoscopic needle biopsy was performed and immunohistochemistry staining showed CK5/6 (+), CK7 (-), PCK (+), Ki67 (LI: about 20%), Napsin A (-), P40 (+), P63 (+), TTF-1 (-), and ALK (D5F3) (focal +), which supported a diagnosis of squamous NSCLC.\nTreatment with sintilimab (200 mg) plus paclitaxel liposome (270 mg) was initiated on 5 May 2021. He then received two cycles of therapy including sintilimab plus paclitaxel liposome (270 mg) and nedaplatin (120 mg) on 2 June 2021 and 30 June 2021. Three weeks after the third infusion of sintilimab, he presented with sudden vision blurring in his both eyes without redness, eye pain, swelling, or other discomforts. No special treatment was performed outside. Approximately 2 weeks after he first developed vision blurring, the patient was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology ( Figure 1C ). On ophthalmic examination, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/300 in his right eye and finger count (eye front) in his left eye. The intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in both eyes. The eye position was normal without proptosis, and the eye movement was normal in all directions. In addition, no obvious redness or swelling was observed in the eyelid and conjunctiva. By the slit lamp examination, the cornea was transparent and the anterior chamber was clear without Tyndall in both eyes. The pupils were round with a diameter of about 3 mm, and sensitive to light reflection. The intraocular lenses were in the right position. Fundus photography showed obvious optic disc edema in both eyes, accompanied by macular edema in his right eye and parapapillary linear hemorrhage in his left eye ( Figure 2A ). By optical coherence tomography (OCT), the average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was 153 mum and 275 mum in right and left eye, respectively ( Figure 2B ). Also, subretinal fluid was noticed in the macular region of the right eye ( Figure 2C ). Visual evoked potential (VEP) showed prolonged P100 latency and decreased P100 amplitude at 60 and 15 arcmin in both eyes ( Figure 2D ). However, the visual field examination could not be performed because of poor vision. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed optic disc fluorescence leakage at the late stage and low fluorescence perfusion at the early stage in both eyes, which suggested anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( Figure 2E ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with gadolinium enhancement was negative for metastatic lesions, recent infarcts, or enhancement in the optic nerve ( Figure S1 ) on 31 July 2021. No orbital abnormality was detected, and the remaining findings of the neurological system and other systems were unremarkable. The patient refused to undergo a lumbar puncture and hence cerebrospinal fluid analysis is lacking. Laboratory evaluations including general biochemistry and serological tests were basically normal, and the results are shown in  Tables S1-S5 . The C-reactive protein was elevated to the level at 22.8 mg/L.\nGenerally, anti-PD-1 therapy activates the T-lymphocyte response against tumor cells while these unrestrained T cells can also aberrantly target normal tissue and trigger a range of adverse inflammatory events, including ophthalmic toxicity. Considering that immunotherapy might induce ischemia by various mechanisms and optic disc edema was severe, the presenting bilateral optic neuropathy was considered as a highly probable sintilimab-related adverse event, and discontinuation of the drug was decided. Consequently, systemic steroids and neurotrophic therapy were recommended. The regimen could consider high-dose methylprednisolone pulse treatment (methylprednisolone 10-20 mg/kg/day intravenously and reduced to 5-10 mg/kg/day for 3 days), then 1 mg/kg/day for 3 days, followed by tapering oral methylprednisolone slowly over 4-6 weeks. Considering the patient's advanced age and the history of tumor, he preferred commencing intravenous prednisolone 60 mg (1 mg/kg/day) daily for five consecutive days and reducing it to 30 mg (0.5 mg/kg/day), then shifting to oral methylprednisolone (started at the dose 0.4 mg/kg/day) with a long tapering over 4 weeks after discharge. About 2 months after the onset of symptoms and while steroid treatment was discontinued for 2 weeks, BCVA recovered to 20/50 in his right eye, and BCVA of the left eye stabilized. Fundus photography showed a slightly pale optic disc with a clear boundary ( Figure 3A ). OCT suggested that the thickness of RNFL in both eyes became thinner than the normal range, exactly 65 mum in his right eye and 74 mum in his left eye ( Figure 3B ). The CT imaging post-sintilimab plus chemotherapy demonstrated a marked reduction of tumor size, consistent with a partial response (PR) to treatment ( Figures 3C, D ). Results of the tumor markers in serum displayed that the level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) reduced to the normal level and the levels of cytokeratin-19-fragment CYFRA21-1, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) were also significantly decreased, while CA19-9 and CA15-3 remained within the reference range ( Table S6 ). At 5 months' follow-up, the patient is clinically well and remained off rechallenge with sintilimab or other systemic antitumor treatment. Moreover, sequential chest CT scans demonstrated an ongoing trend to tumor shrinkage with the response evaluation as the partial response (PR) even after the discontinuation of systemic antitumor therapy.",

    "clinical_text": "A 26-year-old woman presented with a six-year history of dry eyes and dry mouth, shortness of breath on exertion, and fatigue. She was in active military service at the time. Prior to the onset of shortness of breath, she had been in excellent physical health. Six years earlier, she had woken up with severe conjunctival injection attributed to a corneal abrasion. She was evaluated by an ophthalmologist and Schirmer's test was positive bilaterally. She received a presumptive diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome confirmed by minor salivary gland and lip biopsy. She was treated with pilocarpine eyedrops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca. A year prior to visiting our center, she developed recurrent episodes of bronchitis complicated with pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis. Since then, she had persistent shortness of breath. Two-dimensional echocardiogram did not show pulmonary hypertension. She had mild heartburn and an esophagram showed moderate esophageal dysmotility. No evidence of aspiration was found on a tailored barium swallow. She denied having Raynaud's phenomenon.\nPulmonary function tests demonstrated largely normal lung volumes with a TLC of 4.58 (95% predicted), reduced FEV1 of 2.39 L (77% predicted) and FVC of 2.89 L (80% predicted), and preserved FEV1/FVC ratio of 95% without significant bronchodilator response. DLco was reduced at 17.74 mL/min/mmHg (62% predicted). Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation did not demonstrate IgG kappa monoclonal protein.\nLaboratory abnormalities included a very high titer ANA 1 : 5120 speckled pattern, elevated ENA profile at 121 units (normal value: <20 units), SSA/Ro 60 at 114 units, SSA/Ro 52 at 120 units (normal value: <20 units), SSB/La at 148 units (normal value: <20 units), and RF at 20 IUs/mL. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG were elevated at 1104 mg/dL (normal range: 50-462 mg/dL) and 3956 mg/dL (normal range: 700-1620 mg/dL), respectively, while IgM and IgG were within the normal limits. C4 was decreased at 18.3 mg/dL (normal range: 19-52 mg/dL). She had mild normocytic normochromic anemia, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 36%, with elevated inflammatory markers erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 69 mm/hr and CRP within normal limits.\nAn HRCT scan of the chest prior to our evaluation demonstrated pulmonary nodules, thin-walled cysts, basilar predominant ground glass attenuation, and subpleural consolidation (Figure 4(a)). Repeat HRCT demonstrated increased ground glass attenuation, bilateral solid pulmonary nodules, a few of which had slightly increased in size, and stable thin-walled cysts. The pattern was consistent with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) in the setting of Sjogren's syndrome (Figure 4(b)). Amyloidosis and lymphoproliferative disorder/lymphoma remained additional considerations for the solid nodules, which had increased in size.\nThe patient underwent CT-guided lung biopsy of the right lung upper lobe. This was unremarkable for malignancy; however, immunohistochemistry was consistent with light chain amyloid, while the kappa light chain staining was the strongest (Figure 5). There was significant lambda staining, but a clear monoclonal gammopathy was not identified. Amyloid staining did not confirm amyloidosis, and a Congo red stain was not detected.\nThe patient was initially treated with corticosteroid taper. She complained of symptoms consistent with neuropathy as well as constant vertiginous symptoms and visual disturbances of diplopia and intermittent pressure headache. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conductive velocity (NCV) studies were within normal limits. She was found to have acetylcholine receptor antibodies.\nThe patient remained an active-duty soldier. We treated her for LIP with rituximab 1000 mg, 2 doses, 14 days apart every 6 months. Later, IVIG was added to her regimen to address nervous system involvement. Her exercise tolerance improved and DLco normalized (101% predicted).\nIn LIP, lymphocyte and plasma cells are diffusely infiltrated in the lung parenchyma, along with polyclonal plasma cells and lymphocytes. Elevated immunoglobulins IgA and IgG can be the results of polyclonal B cells. On three occasions, the patient's serum protein electrophoresis showed polyclonal gammopathy and on one occasion it showed monoclonal gammopathy. These gammopathies resolved with rituximab therapy, as did the level of immunoglobulins and RF and sedimentation rate. Follow-up HRCT showed an overall improvement in lung involvement characterized by a decrease in ground glass opacities and the solid component of nodules with stability of cysts. We could not exclude that the patient had a low-grade pulmonary lymphoma that responded to rituximab.",

    "clinical_text": "A 58-year-old man was admitted with a three-month history of daily fevers and night sweats. The fevers were preceded by oral canker sores, all but one of which had resolved at the time of presentation. He also had weight loss that he could not quantify and a poor appetite. He denied any other associated symptoms. An automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) had been placed several years earlier for primary prevention of ventricular tachycardia. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient had seen his primary care physician and underwent imaging and blood tests, including two sets of blood cultures that were negative. He was not prescribed any antibiotics. Two days prior to presentation he was seen by his cardiologist, who performed a transesophageal echocardiogram at another hospital. The study revealed global left ventricular dysfunction and mobile echo densities on the atrial aspect of the AICD lead. Additional blood cultures were drawn following which the patient was transferred for further management. Three more sets of blood cultures were drawn after which intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin were administered.\nPast medical history was significant for chronic atrial fibrillation that was managed by AV nodal ablation and a pacemaker that had been upgraded to an AICD three years prior to presentation. In addition, he had psoriasis, gout, and obstructive sleep apnea. Home medications included rivaroxaban, allopurinol, amlodipine, atorvastatin, furosemide, carvedilol, lisinopril, alprazolam, meloxicam, and omeprazole. The patient lived with his wife, owned a cable company, and had never smoked or used illicit drugs. He drank alcohol occasionally. He did not have any pets or animal contact. He had travelled extensively throughout the United States, but not in the past year.\nOn examination the temperature was 100.9 F, blood pressure 125/56 mmHg, pulse 59 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation 94% while breathing ambient air. There was a solitary 2-3 mm ulcer in the right buccal mucosa with a clean base and mild surrounding erythema. The lungs were clear to auscultation and heart sounds were normal without an audible murmur or rub. The pacemaker pocket on the left upper chest had a healed incision and was not tender or erythematous. There were healing psoriatic lesions on the lower abdomen, back, thighs, and forearms. Examination of the fingertips revealed pitting, but no splinter hemorrhages.\nLaboratory data were significant for a leukocyte count of 5,900 cells/mm3, hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, platelet count of 161,000/mm3, and a creatinine of 0.94 mg/dL. Urine dipstick revealed 2+ protein (100 mg/dL). ELISA for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Liver function assays were within normal limits. Chest roentgenogram showed an AICD, with clear lungs.\nFive days after admission, the patient underwent pacemaker lead extraction, excision of the left atrial appendage, closure of a patent foramen ovale, and epicardial pacemaker lead placement. All blood cultures were negative. Serologies for Bartonella spp., Legionella spp., Brucella spp., and Coxiella burnetii were negative as were fungal blood cultures, as well as bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the vegetation and atrial tissue. Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory pathogen multiplex PCR (including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis) was negative.\nIntravenous ceftriaxone was added to the patient's regimen as he remained intermittently febrile a week after admission. Serum IgA antibody to C. pneumoniae was positive at a titer of 1 : 128 as was IgM at a titer of 1 : 64; IgG was negative.\nA broad range PCR and DNA sequencing targeting 16S rRNA gene was performed on the excised atrial tissue by using the MicroSEQ 500 16S rDNA Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The yielded DNA sequence revealed a 100% identity for Dietzia natronolimnaea. A subsequent Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search revealed that D. cercidiphylli has an identical 16S rRNA sequence and cannot be distinguished from D. natronolimnaea using the MicroSEQ 500 Sequencing Kit. PCR was not performed on the vegetation itself, since there was insufficient sample remaining after cultures were performed. Pathological examination of the atrial tissue revealed mild chronic endocarditis and reactive changes in the myocardium, thus satisfying the Modified Duke's criteria for diagnosing infective endocarditis.\nIntravenous vancomycin, gentamicin, and ceftriaxone were continued for an additional 10 days at which time the patient developed acute kidney injury; this was attributed to cephalosporin- related allergic interstitial nephritis. All three antibiotics were discontinued and intravenous daptomycin and ciprofloxacin were administered. The creatinine improved, following which the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a four-week course of intravenous daptomycin and oral ciprofloxacin. Attempts made to contact the patient subsequently in order to follow up on his response to therapy were unsuccessful.",

    "description": "This document reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and treatment strategies for Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid, Bullous Pemphigoid, Oral Lichen Planus, and Linear IgA Disease.",
    "clinical_text": "Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) has been known by different names including benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, cicatricial (scarring) pemphigoid, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. MMP is a common immune-mediated subepithelial blistering disease mainly affecting oral mucosa (over 90%); however, skin lesions are also present in 20% to 30% of cases. The most affected site in the oral cavity is gingivae followed by buccal mucosa and palate. It occurs twice as frequently in females and is generally seen in patients more than 50 years old. Desquamative gingivitis is the most common presentation of the disease, which can be the only feature of MMP. Blood blisters which result from bleeding into bullae are a diagnostic feature of MMP in the oral cavity. Use of topical or systemic corticosteroids is considered as an acceptable treatment for MMP. Furthermore, when there is ocular involvement dapsone therapy is recommended.\nBullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common subepithelial blistering disease, which occurs chiefly in patients over the age of 60. In this entity, oral mucosal involvement is not common. According to Budimir et al., oral mucosal lesions are found in only 16.6% of cases, which are similar to PV but are smaller and less painful. Meanwhile, extensive labial involvement which is common in PV is not present in BP. Desquamative gingivitis has been mentioned as the most frequent oral manifestation in BP and gingivae may be the only affected site. Clinically, oral lesions are not distinguishable from PV or MMP, but early remission of BP is more common. Noteworthy, BP has been reported in conjunction with other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, malignancies, or medications particularly diuretics. Bullous pemphigoid is self-limiting and may last from a few months to 5 years. Topical clobetasol or betamethasone has been suggested in the management of localized oral lesions, whereas, in more extensive disease, use of systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with immunosuppressive drugs is recommended.\n Lichen Planus (LP). Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic, autoimmune, mucocutaneous disease. Most LP patients are middle-aged, and it is rare in children. The disease occurs more commonly in women than in men with a female/male ratio of approximately 2 : 1. The reported prevalence of LP is up to 5%, while the prevalence of oral LP (OLP) is 0.1% to 2.2%. OLP may occur alone or in combination with skin or other mucosal involvement. There are different subtypes of OLP with different clinical presentations: reticular (lace-like keratotic mucosal configuration, Wickham's striae), atrophic (keratotic changes combined with mucosal erythema), erosive/ulcerative (pseudomembrane covered ulcerations combined with keratosis and erythema), bullous (vesiculobullous presentation combined with reticular or erosive patterns), and popular/plaque like (keratotic changes with elevation adjacent to the normal mucosa) (Figure 9). Reticular, popular, and plaque-like lesions are generally asymptomatic whereas bullous, erosive and ulcerative forms are generally associated with pain. Atrophic or erosive LP involving the gingivae results in desquamative gingivitis. This condition has been also found in MMP and PV. The most frequently affected site in the oral cavity is buccal mucosa, followed by the tongue, gingivae, palate, and vermilion border. OLP is considered a premalignant lesion. The risk of malignancy has been estimated to be 0.4%-3.7%, which often develops after 10 years. Hence, OLP should be followed up for a long time. Topical or systemic corticosteroids are usually recommended in management of OLP.\n Linear IgA Disease. Linear IgA disease (LAD) or linear IgA dermatitis is an autoimmune subepithelial mucocutaneous disease. LAD affects both adults and children. Peak of incidence is between sixth and seventh decades of life in adult patients, with a twofold predilection for females. The pediatric variant is called chronic bullous dermatitis of childhood or juvenile dermatitis herpetiform. Oral involvement in LAD has been estimated to be between 5% and 70% in the form of vesicles, painful ulcerations or erosions, and erosive gingivitis/cheilitis. The most common affected site in the oral cavity is hard and soft palate, followed by tonsillar pillars, buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingivae. In a case report by Chan et al., oral lesions were the only presentation of LAD for 5 years. Oral lesions are usually managed with the use of topical steroids, but dapsone therapy for more severe cases is recommended. Resistant cases may require systemic corticosteroids.\n Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa with a global prevalence of 0.5% to 75% and female predilection. The first episode of RAS most frequently commences in the second decade of life. The lesions usually begin with prodromal burning sensation 2 to 48 hours before an ulcer appears. Oral aphthous ulcers typically occur as painful, symmetrically round fibrin-covered mucosal defects with an erythematous border and most commonly on nonkeratinized mucosa in healthy patients (Figure 10). However, it can be seen on the keratinized mucosa especially in patients with immune deficiency. Three clinical types of RAS have been identified: minor-type (Mikulicz) is smaller than 1 cm in diameter (usually 2-3 mm) and heals spontaneously in two weeks. This type constitutes 80-90% of all aphthous ulcers. Major-type (Sutton ulcer) is usually 1-3 cm in size, and lasts for 10 days to 6 weeks or even longer. More than 60% of Sutton ulcers heal with scarring. Major type accounts for about 10% of RAS. Herpetiform aphthae appears as very small (1-2 mm), extremely painful, and numerous ulcers (up to 100 lesions). About 32% of lesions heal with scarring. Diagnosis is based on patient's history and pattern of ulcers. Laboratory evaluation is mandatory when (a) episodes of lesions become more severe, (b) lesions begin after the age of 25, and (c) general symptoms are accompanied by lesions. RAS is self-limiting, but in severe cases topical or systemic corticosteroids are recommended.\n Recurrent Herpes Stomatitis. Herpes simplex virus can establish latency in the trigeminal ganglia and periodically reactivate to cause recurrent herpetic stomatitis (RHS). There are two subgroups: recurrent herpes simplex labialis (HSL) (Figure 11), which is more commonly seen in healthy subjects. It begins as vesicles that rupture soon, which leave superficial crusted ulcers and heal without scarring. Recurrent intraoral herpes (RIH) is more common in immunocompromised patients. However, RIH in immune competent patients is limited to the keratinized mucosa, especially on the hard palate usually as clustered and unilateral vesicles. Common triggers of RHS are physical/emotional stress, UV light, cold weather, hormonal changes, upper respiratory tract illness, and lip/mouth trauma. Although the lesions are self-limiting, symptomatic treatment by using ice or lanolin is recommended. Applying acyclovir ointment 5% every 2 hours since the prodromal phase until the lesions subside has been suggested as well. Elective dental treatments should be deferred in patients with active lesions to prevent aerosolization of the virus.\n Herpes-Associated Erythema Multiform. Erythema multiform (EM) can be induced by several infectious agents, in particular HSV. According to Ng et al., HSV DNA has been detected in 50% of patients with recurrent idiopathic EM typically affecting young adults (20-40 years) and is more common in men with the ratio of 3 : 2. It can be found several days or weeks following an episode of HSV, and the lips are mostly affected. The diagnosis is based on clinical features and is more straightforward when target lesions with preceding or coexisting HSV infection present. History of recurrence has been found in 25% of all EM cases. Patients usually experience 2 to 24 episodes in a year. The duration of disease ranges from 2 to 36 years (mean of 10 years). Acyclovir (200 mg, 5 times a day, for 5 days) is recommended for management of lesions.\n Cyclic Neutropenia. Cyclic neutropenia (CN) is an immunodeficiency syndrome, characterized by regular periodic oscillations in the circulating neutrophil count from normal to neutropenic levels every 21 days, and lasting for 3-6 days. Patients with cyclic neutropenia are usually asymptomatic but during neutropenic episodes suffer from fever of unknown origin, gingivitis, stomatitis, aphthous-like ulceration, cellulitis, perirectal abscess, and severe systemic pyogenic infections. The severity and recurrence of oral ulcers in CN are similar to those of ulcers in major RAS; additionally, periodontal destruction in CN is as severe as what is seen in aggressive periodontitis.\n Behcet's Disease. Behcet's disease (BD) is a systemic immune-mediated vasculitis characterized by the presence of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, and skin lesions. The etiology and pathogenesis of BD are unknown. BD can affect any age groups, but onset before puberty and after the sixth decade of life is relatively rare. The most common age of presentation is around the third decade of life, with a balanced male/female ratio. Recurrent and painful oral ulcers are present in 90% to 100% of patients with BD. The diagnosis of BD is based on clinical criteria. Presence of recurrent oral aphthous-like ulcers (minor, major, or herpetiform ulcers, which recur at least three times within a period of 12 months) along with two of the following: genital ulcers, ocular lesions (anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, vitreous cellularity, or retinal vasculitis), and skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis or papulopustular lesions, or acneiform papulae in postadolescent patients without any steroid treatment, and positive pathergy test) establishes the diagnosis. Glucocorticoids, colchicine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, anti-TNF-alpha (infliximab and etanercept), thalidomide, and rituximab are all recommended for treatment. Topical corticosteroids are not optimally effective against oral lesions. Treatment with infliximab causes complete resolution of recurrent oral ulcers.",

    "clinical_text": "A 62-year-old male presented to the retina clinic with a GRT detachment in his left eye (his right eye had been blind for several years), reducing vision to counting fingers at 1 meter. Following the repair of the retinal detachment (using a combined vitrectomy and encirclement band) in December 2017, his vision improved to 6/36. In the early postoperative period, a large bubble of sub-macular PFCL was noted supero-temporal to the fovea. He was reluctant to having this PFCL bubble removed, since he did not wish to risk a reduction in his gained vision.\nAfter 4 months, he had an uneventful phacoemulsification of cataract, with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens and silicone oil removal (SOR). His left eye vision improved to 6/18, N10 (aided). His vision was stable for over 18 months despite the presence of the parafoveal PFCL. His macula status and the PFCL bubble were monitored using OCT and OCTA, and he was quite satisfied with his vision. At his clinic visit in October 2019 (22 months post-primary retinal surgery), the parafoveal PFCL had migrated to the subfoveal position and this was associated with a reduction in vision to 6/36.\nAs a result of the decrease in vision, he consented to the removal of the subfoveal PFCL. He also had an ERM at this time and the surgical plan was to remove both subfoveal PFCL and ERM.\nSurgical steps for the intended surgery was, first detach the foveo-macula, permitting the displacement (using intravitreal injection of PFCL) of the subfoveal PFCL away from the fovea to a peripheral retina position where it can be safely and easily removed via a retinotomy. Peel the ERM and perform air tamponade. It was the thinking that the injection of subretinal fluid would guarantee a more complete removal of all subfoveal PFCL compared to a trans foveal drainage approach.\nSurgery was performed in October 2019. As in previous surgeries, he gave written informed consent. During surgery, a 39-gauge flexible cannula was used to inject subretinal balanced salt solution (BSS) superior to the fovea (Figure 1), detaching the entire foveo-macula area (Figure 2). A thick ERM was peeled from the detached macula (<PMC7548865_IMCRJ-13-477-g0003_undivided_1_1.webp> and 4). This was complicated by the formation of an iatrogenic macular hole (MH). Intra-vitreal injection of PFCL displaced the subretinal fluid with the bubble of PFCL to the retina periphery. An inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap was created and used to close the MH. A superior drainage retinotomy enabled drainage of all subretinal fluid, which included the displaced PFCL bubble. Air fluid exchange was performed, and the vitreous cavity was filled with air. He was advised to have 3 days of face-down position.\nSince this was a single case report, the institutional review board (IRB) waived the need for a formal review process. Institutional approval was required to publish this case report and a permission to report the case was given by the IRB. A verbal informed consent for publication of his case report and all accompanying images was given by the patient. He was in a remote locality, with limited access to electronic media and was unable to give a written informed consent. This verbal informed consent was approved by the IRB.\nConventional OCT was more valuable than the OCTA in assessing the effect of the PFCL on the outer retina. Pre- and post-operative OCT images as seen in Figures 5-7, show the subretinal location of the PFCL bubble, and intraretinal cystic spaces. Figure 5 represents the parafoveal location of the PFCL, while Figure 6 is the subfoveal migration. In Figure 7 the post-operative microstructure of the retina is imaged. While there is subfoveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane (ELM) in Figure 5, these layers are disrupted in Figures 6 and 7. In Figure 7, there is the presence of subfoveal RPE; the photoreceptors in the subfoveal area are replaced by drusen like material which is most likely degenerated photoreceptors. Also, a layer of ERM is present in the preoperative Figures 5 and 6, but absent in Figure 7.\nThere were significant projection artifacts on OCTA due to the large size of the PFCL bubble. The presence of significant areas of hypo autofluorescence in the OCTA image was as a result of this projection artifacts and imaging within the large PFCL bubble. This demonstrates the difficulty of OCTA imaging of such a large bubble of subretinal PFCL.\nPreoperative OCTA of the parafoveal PFCL bubble in Figure 8 showed the deep capillary plexus was intact. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was oval-shaped, with a wider horizontal diameter. The FAZ appeared to be wider in the deep plexus compared to the superficial plexus. In the choriocapillaris layer, there was a well-circumscribed hyperreflective area within a circular boundary of hypo reflectivity corresponding to the boundary of the PFCL bubble, due to reflectivity patterns from the PFCL. Similar hyperreflectivity was also present in the foveal area.\nIn the preoperative subfoveal OCTA scans in Figure 9 the superficial capillary plexus could be imaged with some difficulty and showed intact vasculature. The choriocapillaris still showed similar diffuse hyperreflectivity within a circular hyporeflective boundary corresponding to the area of the subfoveal PFCL bubble.\nPostoperative OCTA image in Figure 10, suggests there was an improvement in the overall ability to image the vasculature of the retina as shown by improved imaging of the deep and superficial capillary plexus. Imaging of the FAZ in the superficial plexus was defective because of persistent retinal swelling from intraretinal edema. In the deep plexus, the FAZ could be better imaged. In general, there was a fairly intact superficial and deep capillary plexi.\nThe most significant finding was in the avascular outer retina. There was a wedge-shaped patch of hyperreflectivity in the superior parafoveal area corresponding to the area of initial PFCL bubble localization. The choriocapillaris layer no longer had the previous hyper- and hypo-reflective areas described in the preoperative image's Figures 8 and 9.",

    "clinical_text": "In October 2021, a 78-year-old woman came to our tertiary outpatient clinic with the complaint of persistent inguinal pain of severe burning quality (NRS 9/10). Her medical history comprehended osteoporosis, melanoma treated in 2005, and anxious-depressive disorder. She was taking pregabalin 150 mg BID, duloxetine 60 mg QD, clonazepam 30 mg QD, trazodone 75 mg QD, lidocaine patch, and paracetamol/codeine 500/30 mg TID. The pain in the inguinal region started in 2013 after a trauma with multiple fractures involving her right ilio-pubic branch and sacrum; at the beginning, the pain was intermittent, shooting and stabbing in quality, involving the inguinal region, and irradiated towards the ipsilateral labium majus and right upper-medial thigh, and exacerbated by hip extension. In the same year, she performed a selective anesthetic blockade of the right ilio-inguinal nerve without pain relief and a diagnosis while the anesthetic paravertebral block of L1 and L2 determined complete pain relief; a diagnosis of genitofemoral neuralgia was made. Through the years, the pain became gradually persistent with burning quality while pain medications became gradually ineffective. When she came to our attention, she was unable to walk due to the shooting pain induced by her right hip extension while palpation over the pubic tubercle and inguinal region exacerbated the pain; the affected area presented also dynamic mechanical allodynia and tingling paresthesia. She refused surgical therapy, cryoablation, or radiofrequency ablation. Since BoNT/A is an effective and safe therapy in different neuralgias, we proposed BoNT/A subcutaneous injections in the territory innervated by the right genitofemoral nerve, which the patient accepted despite the off-label nature of the treatment. During the treatment period, her therapy remained unchanged.\nThe patient gave her written consent to perform the treatment with BoNT/A. She also gave her written consent to publish her images in this article. For the treatment with BoNT/A, we reconstituted a 100 U vial of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX ) with 2 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% achieving a 50 U/mL dilution; in the third session we reconstituted two 100 U vials of onabotulinumtoxinA in the same manner. In the first round of injections, the total dose was 75 U while in the second and third sessions the total dose was 100 U and 150 U, respectively. The subcutaneous injections were performed with a 27-gage x 12.5 mm needle; we pinched the skin surrounding each injection site to separate the cutaneous layer from the muscular layer. The injections were performed with an injection angle of 30-45 . We applied topical 5% lidocaine creme for local anesthesia to reduce the injections pain. We assessed pain intensity with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory scale (BPI) at the baseline and 1 month and 10 days after each session. The NRS is a score to assess the pain severity using a numeric score that ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). The BPI is an assessment tool that provides information on the pain intensity and interference with daily activities. We calculated the following subscales of the BPI: the BPI pain severity score and the BPI interference score. Patients' Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC) was assessed 1 month and 10 days after each session to determine the level of satisfaction of the patient with the changes in pain severity related to the treatment. The PGIC is based on a seven-point scale: no significant change is a 1-4 response while a favorable change is a 5-7 response. The patient was instructed to note the onset of action of BoNT/A, the duration of the benefit, and the adverse events. The first round of injections was performed in December 2021. The total dose for the first round of injections was 75 U (5 U per site); the injection pain was well tolerated by the patient (Figure 1).\nThe patient described initial pain relief 10 days after the treatment; one month and 10 days later, her pain reduced significantly (NRS 4/10), and she was able to walk. During the third month, the pain gradually returned to baseline. We performed the second round of injections in June 2022 with a total dose of 100 U of BoNT/A; in this case, the pain improved gradually 13 days after the BoNT/A subcutaneous injections and reached a maximum effect a month after (NRS 3/10). The duration of the second treatment was 3 months. The third BoNT/A injections session of BoNT/A was performed in November 2022 with a total dose of 150 U (5 U per site); pain improved gradually 11 days after the treatment and reached its maximum effect after 1 month; in this case, there was almost complete pain relief (NRS 1/10) for 4 months and then a gradual return to the baseline. There were no adverse events reported. The details of each treatment with the BPI, NRS and PGIC scores at the baseline and 1 month and 10 days after each treatment session are shown in Table 1. The patient reported being satisfied with the effect of BoNT/A on pain; she was able to perform most of the daily activities and her quality of life improved very much. The only downside of the therapy, as the patient reported, was that the effect was temporary and not permanent. The fourth round of BoNT/A injections has been delayed due to other medical complications.",

She was asymptomatic, and the general physical examination was normal: her abdomen was soft, with no palpable masses, and not painful. The patient did not report weight loss. In her history, there was hypertension and dyslipidemia, a history of gastric ulcer, previous appendectomy, tonsillectomy, and knee prosthesis placement. She had no family history of colorectal cancer. We performed a full colonoscopy up to the cecum. In the ascending colon, near the ileocecal valve, we observed a nodular mass of about 4 cm mimicking a submucosal lesion covered by normal mucosa with two superficially ulcerated areas ( Figures 1A, B ). A colic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was suspected, and multiple biopsies were performed mainly in the ulcerated parts. Histological examination showed a colonic mucosa infiltrated by cells with morphology and immunophenotype of the plasma cell (CD79a+, MUM1+, CD 138+, CD 20-, Bcl1-) with monotypic chain expression (IgA-k). Deposit of amyloid substance in the submucosa is observed.\nAt subsequent investigations, the abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed the known parietal tumor in the ascending colon without lymphadenomegaly or other pertinent abdominal alterations ( Figures 2A, B ).\nThe laboratory tests confirmed a good general condition without clear alterations of inflammatory biomarkers or anemia; the tumor markers and hepatic and renal function were normal. A right hemicolectomy was performed without adverse events ( Figures 3A, B ). The histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry study confirmed the previous result about plasma cell neoplasm ( Figure 4 ). In particular, macroscopically, a 4.5-cm parietal nodule covered with ulcerated mucosa was identified in the ascendent colon. Microscopically, a neoplasm infiltrates the colon wall and perivisceral adipose tissue; the neoplasm is formed by cells with morphology and immunophenotype of a mature plasma cell (CD79a+, CD138+, MUM1+, CD20-, and Bcl1-) with monotypic expression of K light chains and IgA heavy chains. Deposit of amyloid substance is observed. The pericolic lymph nodes are reactive, without localization of the neoplasm (the details of the complete report are shown in the  Supplementary Materials ). The postoperative course was without complications, and the patient had good general condition at hospital discharge.\nAfter surgery, hematologists performed a PET-CT scan to differentially diagnose solitary plasmacytoma vs. multiple myeloma, but it was negative for other systemic localizations of the disease and documented a complete remission of the unique GI localization. Laboratory serum urinary evaluation was negative, with serum monoclonal component not detected and negative serum immunofixation, urinary monoclonal component non-detected and negative urine immunofixation, and normal free light chain values with a normal ratio. A complete summary of the laboratory tests performed is shown in  Supplementary Table S1 . Bone marrow biopsy defined 40% cellularity without monoclonal plasma cells nor amyloid deposits (details of the complete report are shown in  Supplementary Materials ).\nThe last follow-up hematological visit was 21 months after surgery. Serum-urinary laboratory findings confirmed a hematological complete remission. The clinical conditions were good, without new hemorrhagic manifestations nor abdominal pain, defining an organ complete remission.",

Further, the patient reported a singular episode of epistaxis. Other nasal symptoms such as recurrent epistaxis or sinusitis were absent. Head and neck examination revealed a polypoid mass obstructing the right nasal cavity subtotally (Figure 1(a)). The posterior rhinoscopia showed a partial obstruction of the nasopharynx as well. There was no cervical adenopathy or other disorder in the head and neck. A CT scan of the paranasal sinuses revealed a soft-tissue mass involving the right dorsal nasal cavity, the right ethmoid, and the sphenoid sinus as well the nasopharynx (Figure 2(a)). A strong enhancement was seen after intravenous contrast administration. Further, bone destruction of the right ethmoid structures was demonstrated. In the CT staging, neither local nor distant metastases were visible. The MRI confirmed a circumscribed, submucosal, heterogeneous mass measuring 5 x 2.4 x 4.5 cm, extending from the cribriform plate to the platinum durum, infiltrating the ethmoidal cells and the right maxillary and sphenoid sinus (Figure 2(b)). The cribriform plate also seemed to be infiltrated. The tumor was brightly vascularised with flow signal voids. Conventional digital angiography through the right external iliacal artery revealed a vascular network of the mass, mainly supplied by the right maxillary artery, as also seen in MRI angiography (Figure 2(c)). Additionally, the angiography showed a half-moon shaped blush, in particular of the dorsocranial portion of the tumor, supplied by ethmoidal branches of the right ophthalmic artery. A tumor resection by an endonasal approach was planned upon a biopsy revealing the suspicion of hemangiopericytoma. As the biopsy was followed by a prolonged bleeding and as the radiologic findings confirmed the high vascularisation of the mass, the right maxillary artery as the main vascular feeder was selectively embolised with an ethylene vinyl alcohol dissolved in the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (Onyx) 24 hours before surgery (Figures 1(b) and 3). Following the preoperative embolisation, the endoscopic tumor resection was performed via endonasal approach with a navigation system. Upon resection of the dorsal part of the septum, a pedicled tumor insertion at the rhinobasis was exhibited in four hands technique and resected completely without any complication (Figure 4).\nHistologically, the tumor was submucosal, unencapsulated, and showed fascicular pattern. The tumor cells were uniform, spindle-shaped with oval nuclei, accompanied by an inflammatory cell infiltrate including eosinophils. \"Stag horn\" vessels, as typical for hemangiopericytoma, were focally identified as well as few nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemistry revealed a strong staining pattern to vimentin but no reaction with actin. The cells were immunoreactive for CD 34, slightly for Bcl2 and CD99 but negative for S-100 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). The Ki67-proliferation index was slightly increased at <2%. Due to a high recurrence rate of up to 25%, the patient has been followed up regularly by endoscopic surveillance and MRI controls. One year after surgery, there was no sign of locoregional disease recurrence, neither by endoscopy (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)) nor by MRI (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)).",

    "clinical_text": "A 53-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to a fever lasting for 5 days. He had a medical history of hypertension, psoriasis, urticaria, and had recently been treated with carbamazepine for nerve spasm two weeks ago. Five days before his hospitalization, the patient presented with high fever (39 C), accompanied by chills, abdominal pain, bilateral upper limb muscle pain, and enlargement of retro-occipital lymph nodes. One day before his admission, the patient experienced trunk pain, facial edema, and diffuse erythema on the extremities and trunk. A detailed timeline of diagnosis and treatment is provided in Figure 1.\nUpon admission, laboratory tests revealed that the white blood count (WBC) was 9.03x10^9/L (reference interval 3.5-9.5x10^9/L), eosinophils (EOS) were 1.01x10^9/L (reference interval 0.02-0.52x10^9/L), alanine transferase (ALT) was 251 IU/L (reference interval 9-50 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 144 IU/L (reference interval 15-40 IU/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 366 IU/L (reference interval 100-240 IU/L). Abdominal ultrasonic examination revealed enhanced hepatic parenchymal echo and changes in the cholecystectomy. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal results. Ultrasonography of the lymph nodes revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the bilateral neck, axillary, and inguinal regions. CMV IgG/M, EBV IgG/M, epidemic hemorrhagic fever antibody, anti-nuclear antibody, and nine respiratory virus antibodies were negative.\nAfter admission, the patient developed oliguria (<400mL/24h) and showed elevated serum creatinine levels, liver enzymes, and cardiac troponin I. The patient was diagnosed with DRESS syndrome based on diagnostic criteria (Table 1). Methylprednisolone (80mg, qd) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (5g, qd) were prescribed, resulting in significant relief of skin rash and edema. However, the patient's symptoms worsened after IVIG was discontinued. Laboratory indicators such as eosinophils and transaminases fluctuated throughout the course of treatment (Figure 2), and cyclosporine (50mg, bid) was prescribed. Subsequently, serum creatinine and aminotransferase levels decreased, indicating effective treatment (Figure 2). \nHowever, 63 days after admission, the patient developed fever (38.5 C) accompanied by chills and dyspnea. Laboratory examination revealed an increase in hypersensitive C-reactive protein levels (Figure 2). Blood gas analysis (conducted in room air) indicated a pH of 7.495, pCO2 of 35.5 mmHg, and pO2 of 55 mmHg. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse interstitial infiltrations with ground-glass shadow in both lungs, suggestive of a PJ infection (<PMC10799616_IDR-17-153-g0003_undivided_1_1.webp>). Empirical therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (4 tablets, q8h) was initiated.\n66 days after admission, the patient was transferred to the respiratory intensive care unit for further treatment. Etiological results revealed a large number of PJ cysts in the sputum. Targeted therapy with TMP-SMX (4 tablets, q8h) was prescribed. In light of persistent fever and inadequate improvement in oxygenation, the administration of TMP-SMX was adjusted to primaquine (30mg, qd) in conjunction with clindamycin (600mg, q8h). However, due to the development of methemoglobinemia likely caused by primaquine's side effects, primaquine and clindamycin were discontinued, and TMP-SMX (4 tablets, q8h) was resumed. No PJ cysts were detected in subsequent sputum tests.\nGiven the patient extended treatment with methylprednisolone and cyclosporine, a positive (1,3)-beta-D-glucan and galactomannan test was observed. The presence of spores and mycelium in the sputum suggested possible candida or aspergillus infections, prompting antifungal treatments with caspofungin (50mg, qd) and voriconazole (200mg, qth). Tests for HHV-6, CMV, EBV, and other respiratory viruses were negative. Blood cultures detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was considered a contaminant microorganism. Empirical therapy with meropenem (1g, bid) and fosfomycin (4g, q8h) was initiated to prevent bacterial infections.\nFollowing the patient transferred to the intensive care unit, there was an escalation in the medications administered. The patient developed an intensified skin rash marked by redness and desquamation. Blood tests revealed a surge in lgE levels to 4208 kU/L, indicative of a recurrent or persistent of DRESS syndrome. Chest CT exhibited multiple exudations in both lungs, suggestive of interstitial pneumonia (<PMC10799616_IDR-17-153-g0003_undivided_1_1.webp>). Blood gas analysis indicated decreased oxygenation. Beyond potential infections, the manifestations also raised concerns of immune-related lung damage. In response, high doses of methylprednisolone (500mg, 2 days) were administered. Regrettably, the patient's oxygenation progressively declined, blood gas analyses reflected a worsening condition. Unfortunately, the patient passed away.",

    "clinical_text": "The patient was a 21-year-old female college student with height and weight on admission of 183 cm and 100 kg, respectively. She was admitted to our hospital on April 22, 2023, with a complaint of \"abdominal distension for 2 months that had aggravated since 1 week.\" The patient self-reported menarche at the age of 14 with an irregular menstruation cycle of 5-6/20-40 days, no menstruation on April 20, 2023, and no dysmenorrhea. She denied any sexual history. Since February 2023, the patient experienced abdominal distension, nausea, poor appetite, constipation, and discomfort; frequency of urination was normal. The patient's appetite significantly decreased as her abdomen expanded, leading to a reduced food intake; however, she did not exhibit any attempts to intentionally lose weight. In 2 months, she experienced weight loss of >10 kg.\nPhysical examination on admission revealed stable vital signs, whole abdomen distension, muscle tension, and no obvious tenderness rebound pain. Speculum examination of the anus and vulva revealed no abnormality. A huge mass was observed in the pelvic cavity; its upper margin of the mass was in contact with the xiphoid process; the mass had a clear boundary and was encased in a solid sac; no tenderness was observed.\nRoutine blood exam on admission revealed the following: platelet count, 515 x 109/L; fibrinogen concentration, 6.01 g/L; prothrombin time, 15.7 s; international standard ratio, 1.40; prothrombin activity, 64.3%; D-dimer level, 2.99 mg/L; serum carcinoembryonic antigen, 17.42 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen-199, 28806.09U/mL; carbohydrate antigen-125, 138.70 U/mL; human epididymal protein 4, 227 pmol/L.\nWhole-abdomen computed tomography (CT) revealed abdominal distention, the presence of a large cystic fluid-filled mass in the abdomen, measuring about 40 x 30 x 34 cm, separated cystic cavity visible inside; slight enhancement of the division and cyst wall was observed, but no enhancement was observed in the internal fluid shadow at each stage, and no significant localized thickening was observed in the division ( Figure 1 ). The lower posterior wall was about 2 cm in diameter, with nodular and heterogenous, isodense masses on the right posterior wall. No enhancement was observed at any stage. Uterine compression with left displacement, and no obvious abnormal shadow and compression of the abdominal aorta and adjacent intestinal cavity were observed. Dilatation and hydrops of the right renal calyces and the right upper ureter were observed. No abnormal shadow was found in the left renal parenchyma, and no water was found in the left kidney. No effusion was observed in the abdomen and pelvis, and no significantly enlarged lymph nodes were observed retroperitoneally. Right upper ureter occlusion, right hydronephrosis, and pressure on the right lower ureter were observed. The diagnosis of large cystic mass in the abdomen and pelvic cavity was established. The possibility of a cystic tumor originating in the right adnexa and serous cystadenoma was considered.\nAbdominal color ultrasonography showed the presence of a large cystic mass in the abdominal pelvis and a polyp in the gallbladder. The spleen was enlarged ( Figure 2 ). Color ultrasonography of the urinary system showed mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney and widening of the upper segment of the right ureter, with obstruction of the middle and lower segments, not due to the compression by the large huge mass. No obvious abnormalities were found in the left kidney, left ureter, and bladder.\nGynecologic color ultrasonography suggested the presence of a serous cystadenoma originating from the right ovary. Electronic gastroscopy showed chronic gastritis esophagitis, and electronic colonoscopy showed no abnormality.\nAfter the preoperative examinations, an exploratory laparotomy was performed on April 26, 2023. Intraoperative exploration showed the presence of a large cystic mass in the pelvic cavity; the upper boundary of the mass was close to the xiphoid process, and it was tightly adhered to the anterior peritoneum, lateral peritoneum, and greater omentum. Because the tumor completely occupied the dorsal cavity of the abdomen, its source could not be identified. First, about 14,000 mL of liquid was aspirated from the clear capsule. Then, on exploring the pelvic cavity, it was found that the mass originated from the right ovary; the right fallopian tube was attached to the mass, the uterus was anteriorly positioned and enlarged, and the appearance of the left adnexa was normal. During the operation, 300 mL of the flushed ascites solution was reserved for examination. Peritoneal hyperemia was detected; proliferative nodules and follicular cysts were observed in the omentum; no obvious abnormalities were observed in the appearance of the liver, stomach, diaphragmatic surface, and appendix; the spleen was slightly enlarged; and pelvic lymph node enlargement was not detected. The right adnexa, measuring about 40 x 35 x 15 cm (after aspiration of 14,000 mL of intracapsular fluid), was completely removed. Tumor growth was observed on the surface. Left and right peritoneal tissues and lesion-like tissues of the omentum were retained for examination ( Figure 3 ). The family was informed of the intraoperative situation, and the right appendage was removed first. Intraoperative frozen sections showed the presence of a borderline myxoid tumor (right ovary). Bilateral peritoneal tissue showed hyperplasia of local mesothelial cells. No tumor cells were found in the frozen section of the retinal tissue. Intraoperative diagnosis of \"borderline mucinous tumor of the right ovary\" was made. Due to the patient's young age, her family expressed a desire to preserve her fertility following discussions with the patient. Consequently, during the operation, a recommendation was made for right adnexectomy, greater omentectomy, and peritoneal biopsy. In the follow-up examination in August, CT scans revealed resolution of the mass, and tumor markers returned to normal.\nHistological examination of the mass specimen obtained during surgery showed that the capsule wall was lined with a single columnar epithelium and showed intracellular mucous with epithelial hyperplasia in some areas; cribriform, labyrinth like and papillary structures, were observed, with increased cell layers, disordered polarity, obvious atypia, and visible mitotic figures ( Figure 4 ). Pathological examination of the paraffin section of the right ovary showed mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the swelling and infiltrating type. No cancer tissue involvement was observed in the right fallopian tube, bilateral peritoneal tissue, and greater omentum. Pathological examination of the ascites showed no malignant tumor cells. The ascites cells showed no abnormal mitotic changes. The postoperative diagnosis was right ovarian mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of IC2 stage(T1c1N0M0).",

The patient had a recent history of dysphagia and obstructive sleep apnea along with hoarseness of his voice. However, he had no hearing or neurological problems. There was no significant past or family history.\nOn physical examination, the patient looked comfortable at rest with no speech abnormality. There were no obvious abnormal facial appearance and no evidence of any kind of dyskinesia. The patient had multiple swellings of his scalp, trunk, and left arm [Figure 1].\nNeck examination revealed a solitary symmetrical oval swelling of the left carotid triangle measuring approximately 15 cm x 8 cm with normal skin overlying and no visible scars [<PMC8407632_AMS-11-144-g002_undivided_1_1.webp>]. The swelling was nontender, firm, well defined, with limited cephalocaudal mobility. There was no pulsation, no fluctuation, and negative transillumination. Trachea was shifted to the right side.

Indirect laryngoscopy failed to reveal the mobility of both vocal cords, due to the mass effect of the swelling obscuring the view.\nCervical MRI with contrast [Figure 4] highlighted a large prevertebral retroesophageal mass lesion measuring 13.7 cm x 6.4 cm x 4.1 cm in maximum craniocaudal, transverse, and anteroposterior dimensions, respectively, and displaying isointense signal on T1 and bright signal on T2 WIs with heterogeneous contrast uptake. It was seen indenting the esophagus and the posterior airway column. In addition, MRI of the brain [Figure 5] showed multiple meningiomas with bilateral acoustic schwannomas; findings were consistent with neurofibromatosis type II.\nThe clinical findings and imaging observations were discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting in the same week. The plan was to perform a preoperative tracheostomy and wide local excision of the schwannoma via a transcervical approach. Under general anaesthesia, supine position, and 30  head up, a subplatysmal flap was raised. Marginal mandibular, hypoglossal, and lingual nerves were identified and preserved. An ovoid well-circumscribed mass, with smooth yellow/tan outer surface showing prominent vascular arborization, was identified medial to the carotid sheath [Figure 6]. The mass was seen compressing the left hypoglossal nerve. Successful nerve preserving surgical excision was performed.\nThe specimen was sent for histopathological examination.

    "clinical_text": "A 28-year-old married woman with a primary amenorrhea was referred to our medical imaging department for further evaluation of a shapeless pelvic mass, and to investigate the possibility of having functional ovaries and uterus. Initial gynecological studies such as height, weight, body mass index, and secondary sexual characteristics were performed by a gynecologist. Secondary sexual characteristics of the patient indicated the presence of pubic and axillary hair (Tanner Stage III), her breast examination showed Tanner Stage IV, and the vaginal examination showed a blind vagina. The uterus was not obvious by physical examination. Larche and pubarche, in this case, started at around the age of 13 years with no history of amenorrhea in her family. The laboratory tests, including the hormonal serum profile, showed the normal range of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (2.5 mIU/ml), luteinizing hormone (3.5 mIU/ml), serum creatinine (0.6 mg/dl), and prolactin (9.45 ng/ml). However, the concentration of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was below the normal range (1.5 ng/ml). Moreover, a positive buccal smear, (for determination of gender by observing Barr bodies in the exfoliative cells of both men and women), was also normal. A bilateral renal agenesis with a 95 mm x 72 mm ectopic pancake-shaped kidney on the left side of the pelvic cavity was seen in the ultrasound examination. In addition, the complete absence of the uterus, the cervix, and the upper part of the vagina was also identified during the ultrasound procedure. The size of the ovaries was normal with the echo pattern of follicles between 10 and 14 mm in diameter.\nThe patient also underwent a pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 1.5T (Magnetom Avanto Siemens Medical Solution, Erlangen, Germany). The conventional MR images consisted of: a sagittal T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) (turbo spin-echo), 3 mm thickness, a small field of view (sFOV), 4500/120 ms (repetition time/echo time), with 320 x 320 matrix sagittal T2W, fat saturation, the (3 mm thickness sFOV, 3500/120 ms), T2W coronal oblique images (3 mm thickness sFOV, 4000/120 ms), and T1W TSE with fat saturation axial oblique (3 mm, sFOV, 400/25 ms) with 256 x 256 MATRIX. After intravenous administration of gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (Gadovist, Bayer Pharma, Germany), the contrast-enhanced T1W and TSE images were obtained in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. MR images confirmed ultrasound findings, including the uterovaginal atresia with normal ovaries in shape and size [<PMC6543865_ABR-8-35-g001_undivided_1_1.webp><PMC6543865_ABR-8-35-g002_undivided_1_1.webp> and 2]. The coronal section revealed an ectopic pancake-shaped kidney with no evidence of hydronephrosis [<PMC6543865_ABR-8-35-g003_undivided_1_1.webp>]. An interesting feature in this patient was the existence of the middle sacral artery in the blood supply of the pelvic kidney. An MR angiogram (time of flight technique) showed that the middle sacral artery was the principal artery that supplied the ectopic pelvic kidney [<PMC6543865_ABR-8-35-g004_undivided_1_1.webp>].",

    "clinical_text": "The 10 remaining cases presented with lameness, and accompanying swelling and heat of various joints. Lameness scores on admission ranged from 3/5 to 5/5, with a median lameness score of 4/5. Joints involved included the tarsocrural joint (3 cases), stifle joint (3 cases), coxofemoral joint (2 cases), radiocarpal joint (1 case), cubital joint (1 case), glenohumeral joint (1 case) and coffin joint (1 case). Additionally, there were four cases of osteomyelitis/physitis including femoral osteomyelitis with abscessation (1 case), scapular osteomyelitis (2 cases), and distal tibial physitis (1 case).\nIn 90% (9/10) of cases, radiographs of the affected limb were taken on admission, though only 4 of 9 cases had detectable radiographic osseous lesions. One case was euthanized on admission due to a grave prognosis associated with a large bony abscess involving the right distal femur and medial condyle. Of the remaining nine cases that were admitted, all were started on a combination of antimicrobials including a macrolide plus rifampin and/or ceftiofur. The most common combination was azithromycin and rifampin, which was immediately initiated in 3/11 cases (27%) based on a high index of suspicion of R. equi. Culture samples were submitted from a variety of tissues; R. equi organisms were positively identified in bone (2/2), synovial fluid (2/8), abscess fluid/material (3/4), trans-tracheal washes (2/2), feces (1/1) and lung tissue (1/1 at necropsy). Synovial fluid samples were typically cultured in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture vials.\nOf nine patients that underwent surgical procedures, six had joint lavages performed either through large gauge needles or arthrotomies. The following antimicrobials were instilled intra-articularly: imipenem (3/6), amikacin (5/6), ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (3/6), and erythromycin (1/6). The three patients without joint involvement underwent anesthesia for drainage and debridement of bone abscesses. In eight of the nine patients, euthanasia was elected due to clinical progression of lameness and radiographic progression of lysis and osteoarthritic changes. The mean duration of hospitalization prior to euthanasia was 10.5 days. The ninth patient was found deceased in the stall due to complications from pneumonia.\nThe only patient discharged alive presented with a left forelimb lameness with heat and swelling localized to the coffin joint. The 45-day old foal arrived from a Rhodococcus-endemic farm. Distal limb radiographs did not reveal any bony abnormalities, but thoracic films showed focal pulmonary radiopacities consistent with abscessation. Based on pulmonary lesions and a coffin joint synovial fluid total nucleated cell count of 600 thousand/muL with gram-positive bacteria identified, a diagnosis of R. equi was presumed, but not able to be confirmed on synovial fluid culture. The foal was treated with gentamicin and potassium penicillin broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy for the first 24 h of admission, then switched to gentamicin and azithromycin for the remainder of the hospitalization. In addition, the joint was lavaged, and amikacin was infused intra-articularly on days 1, 2, and 7 of hospitalization. Serial synovial fluid arthrocenteses improved over the course of a 15-day hospital stay, and the foal was discharged on day 15 and lost to follow up.",

The headache and malaise symptoms had been present for two months and started when the patient and his wife vacationed in southern California. While golfing there, he experienced a thunderclap headache associated with fever, nausea and vomiting. The patient sought care at an urgent care facility and was immediately referred to the ED of a nearby academic hospital where he had a CT scan of the head, was diagnosed with sinusitis, and discharged with a prescription for clarithromycin. When his symptoms failed to improve, he returned home to British Columbia, was evaluated at another ED, and given an oxycodone prescription for symptomatic relief. The patient was then followed up with his primary care clinician who ordered an outpatient CT scan of the head which showed sinusitis. Despite completing a second course of antibiotics- moxifloxacin, the patient continued to experience headache, malaise and fatigue. A finding of hyponatremia and worsening symptoms prompted a referral to the ED by his family physician.\nThe patient, a retired communications technician with no significant past medical history and whose only medications included oxycodone and acetaminophen, denied alcohol abuse, illicit drugs use, any known sick contacts, or other recent travel. He gave no history of trauma, change in vision, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, night sweats, focal weakness, paresthesias, incontinence, rash, or joint pain but admitted to a recent 10 pound weight loss, debilitating fatigue, intermittent low grade fever and, of most concern to him, gradual hearing loss which he attributed to wax build-up.\nHis triage vital signs were temperature 37oC (98.6oF), heart rate 127 beats/min, respiratory rate 17 breaths/min, blood pressure 118/57 mmHg, and room air oxygen saturation 98%. The patient was well-developed but appeared fatigued. The external auditory canals were full of cerumen with bilateral decreased hearing which did not improve after wax removal. His neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. The oral cavity and pharynx showed normal mucosa and good dental hygiene. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia without a murmur. Respirations were unlabored and both lungs were clear to auscultation. The abdomen was soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. The skin was warm, dry, and without a rash. Aside from subtle hearing loss and lethargy, neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, motor function (normal tone coordination and muscle strength against resistance), and symmetrical deep tendon reflexes.\nLaboratory examination revealed that the patient had WBC of 13 800/L with a neutrophil predominance and a hemoglobin level of 12.4 gm/dL. A chemistry panel was significant for adescreased sodium of 127 mmol/L, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, and chloride 91 mmol/L. Urinalysis, TSH and liver functions tests were normal. HIV antibody was negative. Chest X-ray and head CT angiogram were unremarkable. A lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 27 cmH2O with colorless cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) containing 59 WBC (38% neutrophils, 42% lymphocytes, 20% monocytes), 6 RBC, a low glucose of 40 mg/dL, and elevated protein level of 2.9 g/L. A cryptococcal antigen titer was strongly positive (> 1:1 024).\nThe patient was immediately given amphotericin B and flucytosine in doses for the immunocompetent host and admitted to the hospital. Several days later, Cryptococcal species were identified as C. gattii. Upon further questioning, the patient recalled that he had visited Vancouver Island seven months earlier. After two months of hospitalization, the patient was eventually discharged neurologically intact except for a continued mild bilateral hearing deficit.",

These episodes were predominantly linked to nighttime, lasting tens of minutes.\nAt first, the seizures appeared in the early morning hours and were described as episodes of bizarre behavior, including grunting, blowing, sitting up, or rocking movements. The patient was mainly unresponsive to verbal stimuli. An inadequate reaction was present if partial responsiveness was perceived. Both seizure frequency and severity progressed over time. The frequency increased to 4 to 5 seizures per month and the duration to 3 h. The timeline of disease development is summarized in Figure 1.\nAntiseizure medication (ASM, levetiracetam) was introduced with a temporary effect. However, increasing doses and a second drug (eslicarbazepine) influenced neither seizure frequency nor severity. The patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation (blood test, cerebrospinal fluid examination, the examination of antibodies against paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis, MRI, and scalp EEG); blood tests, including blood glucose level, were normal. The blood glucose level was measured when no clinical symptoms were present. Interictal EEG showed intermittent slow activity above the left temporal region, but no interictal epileptiform discharges were current.\nTwo typical episodes were captured during video EEG monitoring (<PMC11002118_fneur-15-1371055-g002_A_1_2.webp><PMC11002118_fneur-15-1371055-g002_B_2_2.webp>).

    "description": "This report details a comparative analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and treatment characteristics between Acute and Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia syndromes.",
    "clinical_text": "AEP has been reported to occur twice as often in men than in women and in CEP the ratio between men and women is reported to be equal. However, we did not observe these trends in our review. On the contrary, there was a trend toward male predominance among the patients with CEP and cases of AEP were equally distributed between men and women. As previously reported, AEP patients tend to be younger (20-40 years old), which is consistent with our findings.\nAEP is a severe and dramatic syndrome. This explains the early detection (average of 9.8 days after the onset of symptoms). In comparison, the mean time to diagnosis of CEP is 4.14 months. It has been reported that most patients with AEP are diagnosed within the first week, but the longer time to diagnosis of CEP emphasizes the difficulty in diagnosing this syndrome in an outpatient setting. The severity of AEP is evidenced by the fact that 21% of patients had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and 19.8% required mechanical ventilation. None of the patients with CEP had respiratory failure and 97% had only mild respiratory symptoms. Our results are consistent with those of Philit et al, who reported that 63% of patients had respiratory failure.\nAfter analyzing the radiographic findings, there was some degree of overlap between the 2 syndromes; however, we were unable to find a common pattern. Peripheral segmental/patchy bilateral infiltrates were more commonly seen in patients with CEP than in those with AEP (49% vs 30.4%), and this result was close to statistical significance (P = .06). These infiltrates have been previously described as being prototypical of CEP. In addition to peripheral segmental/patchy bilateral infiltrates, reticular/interstitial findings have been described significantly more often in cases of AEP than in cases of CEP (26.7% vs 14.7%; P <.025). Pleural effusion with parenchymal lesions was rarely found in either group (2.2% of AEP cases and 3.3% of CEP cases). Diffuse ground-glass opacities and an ARDS presentation were exclusively found in the AEP group (11% and 4.4%, respectively). Wandering infiltrates in both lungs is a unique finding of EP and was present in similar rates in both groups.\nOur data showed that peripheral blood eosinophilia was common in the initial presentation of CEP (77% of patients) with an average absolute eosinophil count of 1490/muL. In contrast, patients with AEP generally presented with an initial neutrophilic leukocytosis with no elevated fraction of eosinophils. As the disease progresses, the eosinophil count increases. In this study, only 20.7% of patients with AEP had eosinophil counts >500 cells/muL and the average among those with initial peripheral blood eosinophilia was 1390 cells/muL.\nThe diagnostic criterion of an eosinophil fraction >25% in the BAL fluid was observed in both syndromes, but significantly more in AEP group (95.6% of cases in the AEP group and 80% of cases in the CEP group). No case report could define EP without the presence of either peripheral blood eosinophilia or an elevated eosinophil fraction in the BAL fluid.\nThere are no guidelines for treating these EP syndromes with steroids. The cure rate for both AEP and CEP was very high: 96.6% in the AEP group and 90.1% in the CEP group. In this study, the recurrence rate was significantly higher in the CEP group, which is similar to what has been previously described. In the AEP group, recurrence was rare and the rate was lower than that anticipated based on previous descriptions of a small series of cases. Upon analyzing the use of steroid treatment, we found that 35% of CEP patients were treated only with cessation of the instigating drug, and the associated recurrence rate was only 3.3%. The patients with CEP who were treated with steroids (65%) had a higher recurrence rate (6.5%) and this difference was statistically significant. In the AEP group, the recurrence rate was much lower (3.7%) and most of the patients were treated with steroids (82%). There was no recurrence among AEP patients who were not treated with steroids. One possible explanation for this finding is that the patients with AEP who were not treated with steroids had a milder disease course.\nUpon comparing patients treated with steroids in both groups, there was a significantly higher recurrence rate in the CEP group. It is logical to assume that the severity of the initial clinical presentation led to earlier steroid treatment, but the higher recurrence rate among patients with CEP treated with steroids may be due to premature discontinuation of steroid treatment. The optimal duration of steroid treatment for EP is unknown, but the more common approach is to slowly taper steroids over 2 to 3 months. Although steroid treatment resulted in a very high cure rate and a low recurrence rate in CEP cases, our data analysis revealed that cessation of the implicated drug resulted in no further need for steroid treatment. Steroid-sparing treatment with omalizumab may also be used in patients with recurrent disease if IgE levels are elevated; omalizumab has been recommended as a second-line treatment in patients with recurrence who did not improve with steroid treatment. Because most case reports did not report data regarding IgE levels and because the correlation between IgE levels and eosinophil counts has not been examined in a large series, we cannot currently support the use of treatments based on IgE levels.\nDue to the rarity of this syndrome, very few cases reports have been published during the past few decades, thus restricting the statistical power of this analysis. In addition, the heterogeneity of the published case reports decreases the quality of this data analysis.",

    "description": "A 42-year-old nulligravida with 3 years of primary infertility and recurrent embryonic aneuploidy achieved a healthy live birth following novel ovarian treatments and a single euploid blastocyst transfer.",
    "clinical_text": "This 42- year old Caucasian nulligravida (BMI =20 m/kg2) with primary infertility of 3 years duration attended with her partner. Although the couple had undergone five IVF cycles at two different facilities, none of the 20 embryos generated during treatment were transferred due to genetic abnormalities identified during pre-implantation genetic screening (Table 1). Review of previous clinical records showed consistent, adequate responses to numerous gonadotropin stimulation regimes; no cycles were cancelled (or converted to intrauterine insemination (IUI)) because of poor follicular recruitment. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) here was 0.97 ng/ml, consistent with ovarian reserve appropriate for chronological age. Both partners were nonsmokers in excellent health. Standard G-band karyotypes and Recombine  carrier screening panel (Reprogenetics; Livingston NJ USA) identified no mutations or deletions for either partner. Semen analysis was unremarkable and sperm chromatin analysis returned a DNA fragmentation index of 9%.\nPrior to embarking on her next (sixth) IVF cycle, at this center the patient received autologous PRP injection to both ovaries under ultrasound guidance at this center. Three months later, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with 150 IU/d recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rec-FSH) + 150 IU/d human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) commenced incorporating a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -antagonist (9), selected after review of prior cycle data. While six eggs were retrieved and five advanced to the blastocyst stage, unfortunately all were aneuploid, and therefore embryo transfer was not performed. The following month, after transvaginal ultrasound exam confirmed normal appearing ovaries andreturn of menses post-IVF, a second bilateral intraovarian injection was performed:this time with isolated platelet-derived growth factors prepared as an enriched, cell-free substrate (Neokine ; Chicago USA) using a technique similar to previously reported methods.\nA three, month interval elapsed before commencing her final IVF; for this cycle a GnRH-antagonist was again utilized but gonadotropin doses were adjusted (Table 1). Uniquely, this treatment action resulted in one euploid blastocyst which was cryopreserved on day of trophectoderm (TE) biopsy. Genetic assessments at our clinic and at the outside facilities were uniformly from blastocyst TE biopsy, which provided material for whole genome amplification and DNA tagmentation and PCR of adapter sequences. Next, comprehensive chromosomal screening was carried out by dual-indexed sequencing of pooled libraries on the MiSeq  platform (Illumina; San Diego USA).\nNine days after blastocyst thaw and transfer, the patient's serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was 250 mIU/ml and transvaginal ultrasound at six weeks' gestation confirmed a single intrauterine pregnancy with fetal heart at 153/min. The patient underwent uncomplicated c-section delivery at 39 weeks' gestation had a healthy male infant (3459 g). Mother and child continue to do well at home. Written informed consent for treatment and unrestricted permission to publish/present these data in a non-identifiable manner were obtained by the patient.",

    "clinical_text": "A 47-year-old female, gravida 2 para 0, presented to a general practitioner with fatigue. She had no significant medical or surgical history. Her menstrual cycle was regular and not painful, and she had never seen a gynaecologist. A series of investigations were organised, including a pelvic ultrasound scan which revealed an enlarged, adenomyotic uterus (84 x 67 x 88 mm, volume 260 cc). Both ovaries were normal. An ultrasound scan of the upper renal tract incidentally noted significant right hydronephrosis, with a renal pelvis anterior-posterior diameter of 42 mm and the presence of parenchymal thinning (Figure 1). A CT urogram confirmed the significant right hydronephrosis with marked thinning of the renal parenchyma (Figure 2). On delayed imaging, there was minimal contrast uptake by the affected kidney suggesting no effective excretion. There was no renal, ureteric or bladder calculi seen. The dilated right ureter was identified at the pelvic brim, with surrounding soft tissue density. She was then referred to urology. Blood tests showed CA 125 of 44 U/mL (<30), CA 19.9 of 29 U/mL (<30), and CEA < 0.5 ug/L (up to 4.6). Renal function test was normal. Urea was 5.5 mmol/L (2.5-7.0), Creatinine was 72 mmol/L (45-85), and eGFR was 86 (>59).\nUrine cytology showed red blood cells but it was negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma. A MAG 3 scintigraphy showed that the right kidney was nonfunctional (Figure 3). Cystoscopy, right retrograde pyelogram (Figure 4) and ureteroscopy (Figure 5) showed a normal bladder, and a blind-ending right ureter compressed by a mass with purple discolouration at the level of the pelvic brim. There was no evidence of mucosal abnormality, but a wire could not be passed through the obstruction. She was referred to gynaecology with a likely diagnosis of endometriosis.\nAn MRI confirmed the presence of gross right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter to the level of the pelvic brim, and the ureter was not visible below this point (Figure 6). Marked thinning of the right renal cortex was noted. There was no mass seen adjacent to the ureter at the pelvic brim, however several small bowel loops lied in close proximity.\nSevere endometriosis was suspected based on the findings of unilateral complete loss of renal function due to ureteric obstruction and the presence of adenomyosis. Patient did not consent for definitive surgery, largely due to the fact that she was asymptomatic, her quality of life was not affected, and her right renal function had been lost completely already. Decision was made for a laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis and to assess the severity of the disease in order to facilitate more detailed discussion of required procedure and its risks before proceeding further. Laparoscopy revealed a dense 3 cm nodule over the right ureter at the pelvic brim involving the small bowel mesentery (Figure 7). The uterus was bulky and the rectum was adherent to the posterior uterine wall. Both ovaries were adherent to the pelvic side wall, and a small endometrioma was drained from the right ovary. Definitive surgery would have involved extensive dissection and adhesiolysis to normalise the pelvic anatomy, ureterolysis, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy, excision of endometriosis possibly involving the bowel, and right nephroureterectomy performed by a multidisciplinary team. Patient decided not to proceed with such definitive surgery as she was not prepared to take the surgical risks particularly relating to possible bowel resection. Instead, she was commenced on progesterone therapy for endometriosis and underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal right nephroureterectomy to prevent pyonephrosis in the future. A decision was made to only remove the kidney and upper ureter rather than removal of the ureter in its entirety to the vesico-ureteric junction to minimise the morbidity from this procedure. The kidney was dissected free from its attachments, drained of urine and removed via a laparoscopic port site. The procedure was uncomplicated.\n16 months post nephroureterectomy, at the age of 49, she remained asymptomatic of endometriosis but reported ongoing fatigue. A recent ultrasound showed normal left urinary tract without signs of hydronephrosis, and a MAG 3 scintigraphy showed normal perfusion, function and drainage of the left kidney. She is to remain on progesterone therapy until menopause and to have regular pelvic ultrasounds to ensure the left urinary tract is not affected.",

The patient initially discovered a painless, indurated nodule in their right axilla around a year back. Over time, this nodule increased in size until the time of their presentation that is the size of 8 x 8 x 2.3 cm. The patient attempted ayurvedic treatment for a year, but the lesion continued to progress. On local examination, signs included inflammation of the skin covering the area, occasional discharge of a serosanguinous nature, and mild pain in the affected axilla. The patient did not experience any constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, or loss of appetite. The patient had no family history of malignancy. A physical evaluation and Ultrasonography (USG) for both breasts did not find any abnormalities.

    "clinical_text": "However, with the technological advances of these devices, a recent study considers evident symmetry when both hemispheres have a difference of temperature of as much as 0.4+-0.3 C, and another recent study has shown that, among healthy subjects, the largest difference between both sides was 0.49 C, and that the mean difference among 12 body spots was 0.17 C. Nonetheless, in this case report the investigation regards a patient with stroke, a condition that bears thermoregulation issues.\n Table 1 shows the temperature of thigh and lower leg in anterior and posterior views and the measurement values of the evaluated regions. These images can be seen in Figures 1 and 2.  Figure 3 shows the thermographic image of the plantar cutaneous region.\nBy analyzing the temperature differences at baseline between the plegic and the contralateral side, we observed that only three spots had less than 1 C of difference, all of which were in the feet.\nRegarding the thigh and the lower leg, both had more than 1 C of difference, and the lowest temperature was found in the plegic side. Immediately after the intervention, there was an increase in the difference of temperature between both sides of the thigh in the anterior view, most probably due to an indirect increase of cutaneous blood flow caused by the constant muscle contraction. However, after 30 minutes of rest, we observed that the temperature difference was reduced to less than 50% in both sites, the shin and the lower leg, whereas the values found on the thigh revealed that the temperature symmetry could be considered normal, as long as the difference did not exceed 0.3 C. By analyzing the posterior view of the thigh, the asymmetry remained the same, as the temperature difference was approximately 1 C colder in the plegic side. Concerning the lower leg, the posterior and the anterior view have evidenced a decrease in the temperature difference after the robotic training, especially seen in the anterior view, as, after the 30-minute rest, there was a difference of 0.6 C between both the plegic and the contralateral sides.\nAs for the ROI of the feet, we observed that, before the intervention, the calcaneus had homogenous temperature when both sides were compared, whereas the difference in all the other regions exceeded 0.5 C. Immediately after the intervention, we observed that some specific places, such as hallux, third and fifth toes, and the calcaneus, had their temperature difference increased, as the plegic side experienced an increase of temperature. Nevertheless, after the 30-minute rest, we observed a tendency toward temperature balance between the plegic and the contralateral sides, as the widest difference found was 0.5 C in the third toe and the medial and the lateral regions of the feet, whereas all the other values found (hallux, calcaneus, and fifth toe) could be considered normal, as their difference did not exceed 0.3 C.\nA hypothesis explaining this tendency toward temperature normalization between both sides of the plantar region may be the greater weight load on the feet during the gait training by the robotic device, which may suggest that this training allowed an increase in the peripheral blood flow and, therefore, a more efficient thermoregulation causing the temperature to be balanced.\nAlso, by analyzing the mean temperature difference of the evaluated areas of both sides, we observe that there were 1.23 C before and 1.51 C right after the intervention, whereas the measurements after the 30-minute rest resulted in 0.5 C of difference between both sides; i.e., after the rest period, we observed a tendency toward a normalized distribution of temperature between the plegic and the contralateral sides.",

    "clinical_text": "36 year old patient presented in the accident and emergency of a regional referral hospital with pain and deformity of the right thumb, following an alleged road traffic accident. The patient was unable to move the right thumb, and had a prominence over the dorsal aspect of the right hand. Radiographs of the right hand revealed a dorsal dislocation of the carpo-metacarpal joint of the right thumb without any associated fracture (Fig.1A,B). The patient underwent a closed reduction of the dislocation under intra venous sedation. Following reduction, the TM joint was found stable, and hence it was decided to treat the dislocation in a thumb spica. He was followed up every week for the first 3 weeks with weekly radiographs which confirmed concentric reduction of the TM joint. At 6 weeks the plaster was removed and the patient was referred to the physiotherapist.\nPatient regained full range of movements of the thumb. Radiograph at 15 months follow up showed well reduced and stable TM joint without any signs of arthritis. However there was a calcified shadow over the radial aspect of the thumb (white arrow), which could be due to calcification in the straight antero lateral ligament (<PMC4844493_JOCR-2-15-g002_undivided_1_1.webp>).",

    "clinical_text": "We describe the case of a 62-year-old female patient who was admitted to the neuro intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). She was an obese smoker with inconsistent adherence to her anti-hypertensive regimen. The patient was recruited during admission to the neuro-ICU of the Clinical Hospital at the University of Campinas, Brazil.\nThe patient was admitted after a severe headache for 3 days associated with nausea, vomiting and elevated blood pressure. She rapidly progressed to coma right after admission. The first CT scan after admission revealed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aSAH with Grade V on the Hunt & Hess scale and Grade III on the Fisher Scale. The TCD measurement performed on the first day of hospitalization did not show any signs of vasospasm (mean CBFv of 73 and 83 cm/s, for the right and left MCA, respectively). In the end of the first day after hospitalization the patient underwent an emergency ventriculostomy with EVD placement due to high intracranial pressure.\nThe CT scan obtained in the third and fourth days after admission revealed a diffuse cerebral edema with collapse of lateral ventricles, as well as an extensive ischemic area on the ipsilesional hemisphere. The TCD performed in the fourth day found mean CBFv of 64.2 and 68.3 cm/s on the right and left MCAs, respectively. In the same day, the patient evolved with non-photo reacting pupils and absent corneal reflex. The clinical examination remained unchanged even after analgesic and sedative drug withdrawal. With this prognostic, the clinical staff opted for comfort care. The patient died on the ninth day after hospitalization.\nThe experimental protocol was designed so that the optical measurements would not interfere with any clinical practices. Therefore, the timing of each optical monitoring session was purposely chosen to avoid conflicts with any planned clinical intervention. Most of the monitoring sessions happened in the early afternoon, prior to family visitation hours. No treatment decisions were made based on the optical measurements.\nThe optical system used in this study consists of a hybrid instrument employing a DCS module and a DOS module (Supplementary Figure 1). For details about the optical instrumentation and the optical probe, see Supplementary Methods. In this work, we opted to focus on a single DCS source-detector separation (2.5 cm) and two DOS wavelengths (690 and 846 nm). These separations allowed the optical device to probe the external surface of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as it was shown in previous studies. We developed a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) based on current clinical monitors to control the operation of each module and to display in real-time CBF, OEF, and CMRO2.\nWe utilized the FD-DOS data to estimate the absolute oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations (HbO and HbR, respectively). Total hemoglobin concentration was calculated as the sum of HbO and HbR (i.e., HbT = HbO + HbR). Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was calculated as the fraction of HbO considering all hemoglobin concentrations (i.e., StO2 = HbO/HbT). Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was computed as OEF = (SaO2 - StO2)/(0.75*SaO2), where SaO2 is the arterial blood oxygen saturation. DOS data was combined with DCS data to provide cerebral blood flow (CBF), and metabolism. From CBF and OEF, we estimated the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) as CMRO2 = Hgb * CBF * OEF. All neurophysiological parameters were calculated for each time point continuously every 6 s. The whole analysis procedure is detailed in the Supplementary Methods and can be found elsewhere.\nOptical measurements were taken for five of the 9 days of the patient hospitalization for at least 1 h per day. The optical probe was held on the forehead with an elastic strap. Each brain hemisphere was measured sequentially, for at least 30 min on each side. All monitoring sessions were supervised by a specialized neurologist. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial blood saturation (SaO2), hemoglobin concentration (Hgb) and CBFv from TCD were retrospectively recovered from the medical records and were taken at most an hour before or after the optical measurements.\nDue to the lack of continuous measurement of systemic physiology, we opted to report the average data points of each neurophysiological parameter calculated across each optical monitoring session. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the continuous measurement of all the optical-derived parameters for one representative monitoring session.\nFigure 1 shows a timeline of the main events during the patient hospitalization, along with the daily averages of all the cerebral measurements obtained with our diffuse optical system along with MAP and the CT scans performed during the whole hospitalization period.\nWe started monitoring the patient with our diffuse optical system on the second day following admission, ~32 h after hospitalization. At that time, MAP was 90 mmHg and we found lower CBF and CMRO2 on the ipsilesional side of the PFC when compared to the contralesional side, consistent with lower metabolism following a brain hemorrhage. The OEF and the cerebral blood volume (CBV, as estimated by HbT) were similar between the two hemispheres\nOn the third day of hospitalization, MAP increased to 122 mmHg, and we observed an overall increase in CBF and CMRO2. The increase in CBF and CMRO2 was comparatively higher in the ipsilesional side. In addition, an increase in ipsilesional OEF and a decrease in ipsilesional HbT were also measured, suggesting high metabolic demand due to low blood availability in tissue. No optical monitoring was taken between the fourth and the fifth days due to intermittent clinical care to assist the patient.\nOn the sixth day of hospitalization, OEF was below 40% in both hemispheres. Compared to the second day of hospitalization, CBF increased by 40 and 51% in the ipsilesional and contralesional sides, respectively. However, the increase in CBF was not followed by any significant changes in CMRO2 (Figure 1). From the second to the sixth day after hospitalization, HbT increased in the contralesional side and decreased in the ipsilesional side. MAP at the sixth day was 85 mmHg. For the following 2 days, ipsilesional CBF and CMRO2 further decreased, respectively, by 82 and 69% (compared to day 6), and OEF dramatically increased by ~76%. CBV (as estimated by HbT) decreased in the contralesional side, reaching the levels of the ipsilesional side. The ipsilesional CBV remained relatively stable between the second and the ninth days of hospitalization. MAP decreased to 67 and 45 mmHg during the last two monitoring sessions, respectively.",

    "clinical_text": "Three different pelvic osteotomies (Salter, Dega, Pemberton) are commonly used in patients with DDH younger than 7 years old.   Each of these osteotomies has certain advantages and disadvantages. Thus, Salter osteotomy is easier to perform, but it is possible to improve only the anterolateral femoral head (FH) coverage and provides lower acetabular deformity correction degree compared to Pemberton and Dega osteotomies.   Using Dega osteotomy it is possible to improve the FH coverage in all directions and to achieve a higher correction degree but is technically demanding in patients under 4 years (due to the smaller iliac bone thickness).   Pemberton pelvic osteotomy also allows to achieve higher correction degree, but using it it is possible to improve only the anterolateral FH coverage; another disadvantage after this surgery is a possible triradiate cartilage injury.   \nToday it is well-known that DHH presents itself not purely as an anterolateral acetabular deficiency; three types of acetabular deformities were found.   Thus, there is a need for a pelvic osteotomy that would be able to improve FH coverage in all directions. Other prerequisites for pelvic osteotomy are: to ensure a sufficient level of acetabular deformity correction; to be easy to perform regardless of the patient's age; have no risk of triradiate cartilage injury. In our hospital, we use a modified Salter Pelvic Osteotomy (SPO) that meets the abovementioned requirements.\nThe purposes of this article were:\nto describe our modification of SPO\nto show short and middle-term results after this technique",

    "clinical_text": "This case refers to a 46-year-old patient, admitted to emergency for acute pelvic pain with recto sigmoid mass and mechanical ileus. An abdominal CT scan performed in emergency showed colonic dilation with a stenosing tumor-like mass at the recto-sigmoid bordering the left ovary. The patient was hospitalized in the surgical department for clinical monitoring and further assessment. The next day, the patient developed an acute peritonitis requiring an emergency laparoscopy. In consideration of the suspected malignant origin of the mass stenosing the recto-sigma, the general surgeons performed a temporary transversostomy for bypassing the intestinal obstruction.\nSubsequently the patient was discharged. A PET scan requested for differential diagnosis revealed a recto sigmoid hypercaptation, suggesting a primary intestinal tumor without evidence of lymph node metastases (Figure 1). A colonoscopy with biopsies was performed, showing a recto-sigmoidal stricture, without any evidence of cancerous lesions.\nThereafter, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, revealing a deep infiltrating endometriosis of the recto-sigmoid with involvement of the left pelvic wall and adnexa. The removal of the left adnexa for histopathology was undertaken, while the severity of the infiltration required the postponement of a curative surgical treatment. A series of further biopsies were taken for histological examination, which confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis.\nFaced with a positive anamnesis of invaliding dysmenorrhea despite the use of a combined oral contraceptive pill since the age of 25, the \"off label\" treatment with three doses of 5 mg/Kg intravenous Bevacizumab (Avastin ) at 2-week intervals to control pain relapse was proposed. No dyschezia, nor dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain or menstrual abnormalities were reported in the anamnesis. An informed consent was signed. A good tolerability profile of Bevacizumab was observed, without any side-effects registered during and after its administration. Importantly, the complete disappearance of dysmenorrhea was observed at the end of therapy. A second PET-scan was then performed, highlighting the suppression of metabolic activity of the endometriotic nodule in the pelvis.\nOne month after the last dose of Bevacizumab, a second-look intervention with recto-sigmoid resection, removal of residual endometriosis and contralateral adnexectomy was performed. Macroscopically, endometrial lesions remained unchanged in dimension. However, they healed in a fibrous fashion that made dissection difficult. Histopathology confirmed a diffuse fibrosis. Interestingly, compared to the pre-treatment biopsies, a shift in the hormonal receptors profile toward a higher estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors expression was highlighted (Table 1).\nCurrently, at 6-month follow-up, the protective transversostomy has been removed and the patient is symptoms-free under a continuous combined hormonal substitutive therapy. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report (including all data and images).",

    "clinical_text": "A 50-year-old female presented in July 2007 to a peripheral general hospital with progressively enlarging mass in the anterior abdominal wall of one-year duration. On physical examination, she was well built with normal vital signs. A 7 x 6 cm firm irregular subcutaneous mass was felt in the right lower para-umbilical area of the anterior abdominal wall. On palpation, the abdomen was soft and lax with no intra-abdominal masses. There were no palpable lymph nodes. Her cardiac and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a mass within the abdominal wall. Her laboratory investigations were within normal limits. A plain chest X-ray was unremarkable.\nWide local excision with safety margins of the tumor was done. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on the second postoperative day in a satisfactory condition.\nGross examination of the specimen showed an ellipse of skin that measured 13 x 10 cm with subcutaneous fatty tissue measuring 11 cm in thickness. On cut section, a well-defined nonencapsulated grayish yellow mass measuring 7 x 6 cm with foci of necrosis was seen. No skin infiltration or abdominal skeletal muscle involvement was noted.\nMicroscopic examination revealed well-defined but nonencapsulated subcutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm composed of irregular islands of large cells with mostly round to oval pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, with markedly granular cytoplasm, and several large eosinophilic globules (Figure 1(a)). The nuclear cytoplasmic ratio was variable, with several cells having large nuclei. The tumor nests were surrounded by bands of fibrous connective tissue (Figure 1(b)).\nMany foci of tumor necrosis and scattered mitotic figures, 4 per 10 HPF at a magnification of 200, were identified (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). Margins of resection were free of tumor.\nImmunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be strongly positive for vimentin, S100 and CD68 (Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c)). Stains for cytokeratin (CK), smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, and myogenin were all negative. Ki-67 proliferative index was 3-5% (Figure 2(d)). PAS stain highlighted the granules and the eosinophilic globules within the cytoplasm of tumor cells.\nThe patient was referred in September 2007 to the Oncology Clinic at our hospital for regular follow-up. A chest CT done on May 2008 showed small right lung nodules measuring 0.48 cm of uncertain significance. In April 2010, a follow-up of her chest CT showed bilateral multiple lung nodules; the largest was in the right upper lobe measuring 1.5 x 1 cm. Pelvic CT on February 2011 revealed a large right inguinal mass measuring 3.2 x 2.1 cm. Palliative chemotherapy was planned for the patient. She was started on doxorubicin and ifosfamide for 6 cycles; the last cycle was in October 2011 and then she refused to continue treatment.\nIn September 2012, FNAC of the inguinal lymph node showed numerous clusters and single cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei.\nIn December of 2015 she was started on docetaxel single agent for 6 cycles; the last cycle was completed by April 2016. In January 2018, her last follow-up chest CT reveled an increase in the size of all metastatic nodules. The largest nodule was in the right upper lobe and measured up to 5.2 x 4.9 cm. It had increased in size since July 2017 when it measured at that time 4.4 x 4.3 cm (Figure 3(a)). In addition, the inguinal lymph node increased in size up to 8.24 x 7.89 cm (Figure 3(b)).

Two months previously, she presented with a fever, cough, and expectoration. At that time she was diagnosed with \"invasive pulmonary fungal disease\" and was given oral voriconazole and biapenem as empirical therapy. Her condition improved gradually after this treatment. Four days prior to the current admission, she was admitted because of a relapse of fever, with a body temperature of 38.6 C.\nA physical examination showed that her underarm temperature was\n38.6 C, pulse was 108 beats/min, breathing was 25 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 109/67 mmHg. There was dullness on lung percussion and strong vocal fremitus with fine crackles in the left lung. Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 3.61x109 per L (normal: 3.5-9.5), red blood cell count of 3.22x1012 per L (normal: 3.8-5.1), hemoglobin concentration of 112g/L(normal: 110-150 g/l), platelet count of 268x109 per L (normal: 125-350), and absolute neutrophil count of 2.02x109 per L (norma: 1.8-6.3). In addition, the 1,3-beta-D-glucan level was normal, and an aspergillus antigen test for serum galactomannan was negative. The liver function, renal function, and electrolyte levels were all normal. There were negative results for antinuclear antibody (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), TB spot test and TB blood culture. Computed tomography (CT) on July 14, 2020 indicated consolidation in the left lower lung (  Figure 1  ). Therefore, we made a preliminary diagnosis of CAP with acute myeloid leukemia.\nAs the empirical anti-infective therapy, we administered biapenem (0.3 g, Q6H), but her condition did not improve. On day 3 after admission, the urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumonia and anti-Legionella antibodies were negative. To identify the etiology, we collected BALF and tested it with mNGS using the MiSeq platform (Illumina). The results indicated 46 sequence readings of Legionella pneumophila ( Table 1 ) with a coverage of 0.07% ( Table 2 ). Sequencing of 16s rRNA sequencing using Nanopore GridION also detected the 17 L.pneumophila sequences in the same DNA sample.\nCombined with her medical history, clinical symptoms, physical signs, results from auxiliary examinations, and mNGS, we diagnosed the patient with Legionella pneumonia and adjusted the treatment plan to intravenous moxifloxacin and azithromycin. After 14 days of treatment in the hospital, the patient's fever had resolved, and she was discharged, and prescribed antimicrobial agents as sequential oral therapy. A CT follow-up after one month (August 16, 2020) indicated the pulmonary lesions in the left lower lung were significantly absorbed ( Figure 2 ). Records of her white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, and other results indicated gradual improvements during her hospital stay ( Figure 3 ).",

She did not complain of any history of trauma or nipple discharge and had no history of breast disease. There was no family history suggestive of breast malignancy.\nOn clinical examination, a large, ill-defined, non-tender mass involving the entire right breast was noted which was also close to the nipple-areolar complex (Figure 1). The left breast and axillae appeared unremarkable.\nUltrasonography (USS) of the breast demonstrated diffuse right breast enlargement with an ill-defined mixed echogenic lesion in the retro-areolar region (22 mm x 12 mm). No enlarged lymph nodes were observed, and the left breast and axilla appeared normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the breasts showed an ill-defined mass lesion in the right breast mainly involving central and medial quadrants measuring 6.0(T) x 7.7(AP) x 9.0 cm (CC) with heterogeneous signals in it. The medial aspect of the tumour was solid and showed T1W low signals, T2W fat at iso signals and avid contrast enhancement. These areas showed diffusion restriction and rapid washout in the kinetic curve. Prominent internal mammary vessels were noted adjacent to the medial margin of the lesion. A 2.6 x 3.2 x 2.4 cm multi-loculated cystic area was noted within the lesion medial to the nipple. The heterogeneous enhancing solid component of the lesion is in the retro areolar region with skin infiltration (5 cm diameter). A breast neoplasm such as angiosarcoma was the likely diagnosis on MRI interpretation (Figure 2). To rule out metastasis, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was performed, yielding negative findings.\nMultiple core biopsies were obtained from different sites within the lesion. The histopathological analysis revealed a vascular lesion characterized by complex anastomosing spaces and a dense collagenous keloid-like stroma. These spaces were mostly empty and the lining cells were devoid of nuclear atypia or mitoses negating a malignant diagnosis. These features suggested a pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), offering no evidence of a definite malignancy.  \nThe patient was extensively discussed at the multidisciplinary meeting. Since there was a discrepancy in the radiological and pathological diagnosis, the decision was made to carry out a mastectomy with or without reconstruction following a discussion with the patient. The diagnosis, the discrepancies, possible outcomes and pros and cons of reconstruction were discussed in detail with the patient. The patient requested an immediate reconstruction. Following this, a decision was made to proceed with skin-sparing mastectomy with reconstruction using a latissimus dorsi muscle flap and implant which yielded satisfactory cosmetic results.\nThe macroscopy of the right mastectomy specimen revealed a tumour mass occupying the entire specimen and measuring 100 x 90 x 30 mm. Microscopy revealed predominantly bland endothelial lined vascular channels. The erythroblast transformation-specific related gene was positive. Twenty percent of the tumour was solid with pleomorphic cells. Ki67 proliferative index was performed which was 50%. It was diagnosed as a well-differentiated primary angiosarcoma of the breast. All margins were free of tumour/R0 resection (Figure 3).\nThe patient was re-discussed at the multidisciplinary meeting and considered for radical mastectomy and chemo-radiotherapy. The patient declined further treatment and is on close follow-up. The patient was counselled regarding the possibility of recurrence, the need for close follow-up and the necessity for radical surgery if recurs. She is being followed up in the breast clinic 3 monthly with clinical assessment and ultrasonographic imaging. Post op 6 month, the patient is disease free and is continuing the follow-up plan.",

The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum (Figure 1). The polyp was removed en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift. Two endoclips were placed for hemostasis. Pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma (Figures 2, 3, and 4) with predominantly low grade dysplasia (Figures 5 and 6) and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia. The slides were read by the in-house pathologist and were also reviewed by a GI expert pathologist at the University of Michigan. The patient was recommended to follow up for surveillance upper endoscopy in 6 months due to the areas of high grade dysplasia found on pathology. He was lost to follow-up for over one year. Fifteen months after the PGA was removed, the patient did follow-up for a surveillance upper endoscopy. A duodenal scar was found at the site of the PGA and a biopsy was taken from the site. There was no evidence of residual pyloric gland adenoma. The patient was then recommended to follow up for surveillance endoscopy in 5 years in accordance with the ASGE guidelines for surveillance of gastric adenomatous polyps.",

Menarche had occurred at age 14. She had used oral contraceptives for nine years, having stopped taking them four years ago, followed by regular menses. No one in her family had history of infertility or any type of gynecologic cancer.\nGeneral examination and body mass index were normal. Analytically she had normal blood count and hormonal assay [FSH, LH, TSH, free T4, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)]. A transvaginal ultrasonography was performed revealing a normed uterus and ovaries slightly enlarged and polycystic with a small echogenic mass in the right ovary of 15 millimeters. The hysterosalpingography was normal.\nHer husband was healthy and had no relevant past medical history and his semen analysis was normal.\nShe was proposed for a diagnostic laparoscopy and ovarian drilling. In the surgery, both ovaries were polycystic and a yellowish nodular solid and hardened formation of about two centimeters, vascular and friable to touch, was observed in the right ovary. That mass was removed, without rupture, and removed in an endoscopic bag. Tubal patency test confirmed bilateral permeability.\nThe removed mass was sent to histological examination. Macroscopically, it was a yellow-colored tumor measuring two centimeters in greatest diameter, with a smooth and well-limited surface. Microscopically, the ovarian parenchyma was almost entirely occupied by a tumor lesion, represented by large polyhedral cells with small nuclei and vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm, without mitosis and nuclear atypia. Hemorrhage and necrotic areas were absent (Figure 1). Immunohistochemical study revealed diffuse marking for calretinin, vimentin, and melan-A (Figure 2). These features were consistent with ovarian steroid cell tumor NOS.\nIn the postoperative period, the woman is followed up with serial measurements of serum testosterone levels and transvaginal ultrasound. At 24 months, she had no evidence of recurrence and began follow-up in reproductive medicine consultation. She was proposed to in vitro fertilization treatment, but despite gonadotropin therapy (in high doses, 300U) for ovarian stimulation, she had no response. At 36 months postoperatively, she is still not pregnant and no evidence of recurrence too.",

The bleeding was heavy and in clots with associated generalized body weakness and increased exercise intolerance. There was neither history of trauma, tooth extraction, nor treatment with medications known to encourage bleeding such as warfarin or heparin. The patient had neither family history of bleeding disorder nor past history of haemoptysis, epistaxis, haematuria, melaena stool, and easy bruising. The visual loss was sudden, progressive, and essentially painless, with the left eye (LE) being first affected followed by the right eye (RE) about a month after. The patient denied any history of eye disease or diabetes mellitus in self or family. He neither smoked cigarettes nor imbibed alcohol. He was found to have mild hypertension elsewhere shortly before presentation but had not been placed on any antihypertensive drug. The general examination revealed a middle-aged man, mildly pale, and essentially in stable general clinical state. The respiratory rate was 22 cycles/min, pulse rate was 136 beats/min, and BP was 140/90 mmHg. The essential ocular findings were bilateral hyperpigmented infraorbital skin lesions, visual acuities (VA) of hand motion in both eyes, round and sluggish pupils, and diffuse and extensive retinal haemorrhages obliterating the retinal details. The intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes. There were central visual field defects, worse in the LE (Figure 1).\nThe optical coherence tomography revealed retinal haemorrhage, oedema, detachment, and diffuse photoreceptors damage (Figure 2).\nThe results of initial blood investigations showed reduced Na+, bicarbonate, and alkaline phosphatase and elevated creatinine (Table 1).\nThe coagulation studies showed elevated PT and PTTK results with INR = 1.42 (0.9-1.3). The serum protein electrophoresis revealed a large monoclonal peak (75.1 g/dL) in the beta-region which was shown to be IgG Lambda by serum and urine immunofixations. beta 2-microglobulin was elevated -7.1 (1.16-2.52 mg/dL) with normal lactate dehydrogenase. The bone marrow examination showed a cellular marrow with reduced megakaryopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and erythropoiesis and increased lymphocytes (61%) with plasma cells constituting only 2% of nucleated cells in the marrow. Immunocytochemical studies at a reference laboratory showed positivity for CD138, CD56, and CD 20 with negativity for CD 38 suggestive of lymphoplasmacytic differentiation, while eyes findings including bilateral blindness and retinal features mimicking central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) are suggestive of hyperviscosity retinopathy. Therefore, a diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma complicated by hyperviscosity retinopathy was made.\nIn the absence of an aphaeresis machine the patient was given four cycles of manual EBT to address the hyperviscosity as well as tablet allopurinol 100 mg/day, tablet chlorambucil 8 mg daily (0.1 mg/kg/day), tablet prednisolone 20 mg bd, and liberal fluids orally. Additionally, eye medications including gutt Zaditen Ophtha (Ketotifen Fumarate) every 8 hours in both eyes and tablet Diamox (acetazolamide) 250 mg every 12 hours were administered.\nFollowing treatment, the patient's general condition improved with less body weakness and improved vision. The gum bleeding and pain also subsided. The VA initially improved to 6/18 (both eyes) about a month into the treatment and stabilized at 6/12 (RE), 6/36 (LE) five months into treatment without any improvement with pin hole test. Nevertheless, the near vision improved from N36 to N8 (RE) but remained N36 (LE) with +1.50 DS presbyopic correction. There was no improvement in distance vision following refraction. The IOP stabilized between 12 and 10 mmHg.",

    "clinical_text": "For single crown restorations, the following case is aimed at illustrating the prosthetic procedure. A 23-year-old, healthy female patient diagnosed with periodontitis suffered from apical periodontitis after root canal treatment on tooth 36. Due to a hopeless prognosis, a decision was made to extract the tooth and to use delayed implantation with a one-piece implant. The clinical situation after atraumatic extraction showed no signs of inflammation and sufficient quantity of soft tissue (Figure 4(a)). Assessment of the correct position and dimensions for the planned reconstruction was realized using a radiograph with calibration ball. After implantation with a one-piece implant (FairOne ; diameter: 5.0 mm and length: 10 mm), it was ensured that no interference in the static or dynamic occlusion is occurring during healing. Minimal adjustments can be performed by means of the preparable head. In order to achieve accurate transmission for the prosthetic restoration, the geometric design should be preserved. This provides the possibility for direct impressions or digital scanning with high-detail reproduction and precision. In the posterior region, no provisional restoration was necessary during the healing phase, since there is no additional surgery for uncovering of the implant and no abutment dis-/reconnection shaping of the emergence profile occurred early during the initial healing phase on the continuous rough surface (Figure 4(b)). Additionally, the baseline of the bone crest in the mesial and distal direction is documented (Figure 4(g)). The impression could be performed using a double-mix technique with a polyether (Impregum , 3M, Landsberg am Lech, Germany) (Figure 4(c)). Within the laboratory process, a master cast in conjunction with an implant analog and gingival mask was used adjusting the prosthetic restoration and ensuring that the emergence profile of the crown is optimally contoured (Figure 4(d)). In cases were the clinical situation causes interference with the crown design, a transfer coping joined with pattern resin is fabricated. This could enable the surgeon to realize defined adjustments for the prosthetic head prior to the crown fitting and cementation process (Figure 4(e)). CAD/CAM processing is possible with the use of a digital implant model analog (CAM-Analog, FairImplant GmbH, Bonningstedt, Germany). The final restoration was placed using a metal-supported ceramic crown (Figure 4(f)). Provisional cementation for up to four weeks securing the final fitting of the contact situation in the approximal area and adjustment of the occlusal situation as well as the color of the crown was conducted with eugenol-free temporary cement (TempBondNE , Kerr GmbH, Bioggio, Switzerland). The permanent cementation was usually conducted using a dual-curing dimethacrylate composite with a custom analog for precementation to significantly reduce excess cement (PANAVIA F , Kuraray Noritake, Tokyo, Japan). Implant placement should ideally by controlled by periapical radiographs that were taken by the use of a long-cone paralleling technique. After 10 weeks of implant treatment, a slight loss in bone height adjacent to the implant in the mesial and distal direction could be observed but no excess of cement is evident (Figure 4(h)). The patient reported no complications during the procedure and the healing period. Nine years after implant placement, remineralisation and formation of new bone at the peri-implant interface can be observed presenting stable biological conditions (Figure 4(i)).",

    "clinical_text": "This case report describes a male child delivered at term via elective cesarean section without any complication. Both his parents were healthy and came to the obstetrician regularly for antenatal monitoring. The patient was the family's first child with no history of his relatives suffering from the same condition. From physical examination, an abnormally flexed left knee was observed at birth along with bilateral undescended testis and syndactyly of the left foot. The left popliteus pterygium runs from the buttock to the calcaneus, with an associated knee flexion contracture. The patient could not extend his knee as the popliteal pterygium caused a 90  rigid knee-flexion contracture (<PMC10051030_ORR-15-47-g0001_undivided_1_1.webp>). The parents opted for multiple traditional massages, and physiotherapies were performed without satisfactory results. The patient was initially encountered in our outpatient department at ten months of age. The delayed treatment was due to administrative problems including health insurance and the referral process. \nSurgical intervention was planned after an angiographic CT scan revealed that there were no vascular disturbances (<PMC10051030_ORR-15-47-g0002_undivided_1_1.webp>). We thoroughly informed the patient's parents that although fascicular shifting is a relatively new technique to be implemented especially in human and its failure rate is considered common, the realistic goal from releasing the contracture is to enable brace utilization daily. To these, the parents gave their full informed consent. \nMultiple Z-plasties through a posterior approach along with excision of the fibrotic band were performed. After meticulous dissection, a tight sciatic nerve was encountered (<PMC10051030_ORR-15-47-g0002_undivided_1_1.webp>). Fascicular shifting procedure was performed to extend the sciatic nerve for approximately 7 cm. The sciatic trunk was exposed at the popliteal level, and an 8-cm fascicular segment was excised from the distal stump and sutured to the proximal stump using 10/0 non-absorbable thread under an operating microscope (Zeiss) (Figure 3). The chosen length of fascicular segment was unlike previous reports in other centers which excised a much shorter segment.",

    "clinical_text": "A 30-year-old woman with a 5-year history of refractory occipital neuralgia, who had been under ONS therapy for 2 months, presented with a sudden onset of severe unilateral pain, originating in the right upper nuchal region and spreading to the occipital and parietal regions. The pain was described as stabbing, sharp, lancinating, and occurred in paroxysms. The patient also described spasms and myoclonus that occurred in the right trapezius, scalene, and supraspinatus muscles, a new symptomatic component that had not accompanied her typical occipital neuralgia pain before.\nThe patient had a history of microvascular decompression surgery 6 years before as a treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, with full remission of symptoms. She developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and mastoiditis as immediate postoperative complications, but they were appropriately and successfully managed.\nDue to the failure of medical therapy for occipital neuralgia (pregabalin and duloxetine), the patient had been submitted to three percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomies (1, 3, and 4 years ago) which provided immediate symptomatic relief and yielded significant pain control, but for a limited time. She had also received two occipital nerve blocks through local anesthesia, but with poor effect in long-term pain management.\nThe pain had become progressively more severe, more frequent and associated with nausea. As a result of the unresponsiveness to less invasive procedures, the patient underwent ONS 2 months ago.\nONS was employed through surgery. The patient was placed in prone position under anesthesia. A right paramedian incision was performed in the level of C1 vertebra and a pathway was carefully dissected over the muscle fascia, toward the mastoid region. Once the correct position was asserted through fluoroscopy, a lead containing 16 electrode contacts was inserted and anchored over the muscle fascia. The IPG was placed in the infraclavicular region, in a subcutaneous pocket, and connected to the lead extension, which was inserted through subcutaneous tunneling. A stress relief loop was produced with the lead cable extension in the subcutaneous pocket, alongside the IPG, forming a circular coil to minimize tension on the lead [<PMC8168692_SNI-12-189-g001_undivided_1_1.webp>]. The technique provided adequate pain management after optimization of the IPG settings.\nTwo months after ONS were implemented, the patient suddenly started with the symptoms and manifestations described. When the ONS system was turned off, the spasms and myoclonus ceased. A skull radiography showed lead migration [Figure 2].\nThe patient underwent surgery for lead repositioning. During surgery, extensive fibrosis was identified throughout the lead extension loop, which was deemed as cause for the lead migration. The fibrosis produced numerous points of constriction along the stress relief loop, which provided tension over the lead during head-and-neck movement and caused its migration.\nWe conducted thorough dissection of the fibrotic tissue, releasing the stress relief loop, and removing the IPG from the infraclavicular subcutaneous pocket [<PMC8168692_SNI-12-189-g003_undivided_1_1.webp>]. A low cervical incision was made over the dislocated lead position guided by fluoroscopy and new tunneling was performed due to important fibrosis in the subcutaneous that restrained the lead from being removed. The lead and cables were then removed through the infraclavicular incision. The lead was repositioned through the former occipital incision and the system was reinserted as described previously [<PMC8168692_SNI-12-189-g004_undivided_1_1.webp>].\nAfter lead repositioning, the patient did not experience any muscle spasms or myoclonus. The pain intensity significantly decreased and the IPG settings are still being managed to optimize pain control.",

    "clinical_text": "A 69 year-old post-menopausal woman presented to her primary care physician with several months of increasing terminal hair growth on her face, torso, and arms, requiring shaving. There was also recession of the hairline, but no clitoromegaly. An initial endocrine evaluation demonstrated a markedly elevated serum total testosterone of 160 ng/dL (normal 5-32 ng/dL). ACTH level was normal, and the DHEA-S level was below assay detection. Initial transvaginal pelvic ultrasound demonstrated two simple cysts measuring 11 x 12 x 8 mm and 11 mm, and a 6 x 6 x 7 mm hypoechoic structure in the right adnexa; the left ovary was not visualized. A follow-up transvaginal pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a normal right ovary measuring 17 x 5 mm and a 13 x 9 mm left paratubal cyst; the left ovary was again not seen. An MRI of the pelvis did not demonstrate any adnexal masses, and an adrenal MRI was unremarkable as well.\nHer past obstetrical history was notable for six pregnancies, one vaginal delivery, one tubal ectopic pregnancy, and four 2nd trimester spontaneous abortions. Her past medical history included Crohn's disease status-post total colectomy and ileostomy. Her condition was complicated further by fistula formation through an appendectomy scar, stoma relocation, hernia repair, and development of a secondary large parastomal hernia. These operations resulted in scarring of the inside of her entire abdomen and replacement of her left lower quadrant by the large parastomal hernia. She also had chronic renal insufficiency with the serum creatinine elevated to 1.3-1.6 mg/dL. Other less significant factors in her medical history were renal stones status-post surgical removal, polymyalgia rheumatica, restless leg syndrome, asthma, arthritis, and osteoporosis, and depression.\nOn physical examination, the patient's height was 63 in and weight was 157 lb (body mass index, 27.9 kg/m2). Her blood pressure was 122/81 mmHg. Skin examination confirmed the presence of extensive hirsutism of the face, neck and chin, and significant frontotemporal balding.\nHer medications at initial evaluation included an albuterol inhaler, fluticasone, benzonatate, lactobacillus, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, cyanocobalamin, fenofibrate, omeprazole, zolpidem, citalopram, gabapentin, hydrocodone, pramipexole, furosemide, and zoledronic acid, none of which are known to have androgenic side effects.\nHer family history was non-contributory.\nGiven the low levels of DHEA-S and normal adrenal imaging, an adrenal source for the testosterone was thought to be unlikely, and an ovarian source was suspected. The patient was referred to a gynecologic oncologist for possible surgical exploration and oophorectomy; however, she was deemed to be a poor operative candidate due to her multiple prior abdominal surgeries and massive lower left quadrant parastomal hernia. The patient was then referred to the reproductive endocrinology clinic for possible medical management.\nPhysical examination confirmed a cheerful, elderly white female with an evident shaven beard, and hairline recession. Laboratory testing demonstrated: testosterone 100.6 ng/dL (normal 2.9-40.8 ng/dL), FSH 112.1 mIU/mL (normal 25.8-134.8 mIU/mL), LH 62.4 mIU/mL (normal 7.7-58.5 mIU/mL), and estradiol 9 pg/mL (normal 0-47 pg/mL). Her hemoglobin A1c at this time was 5.9% (normal <6.0%). Lipid levels several months prior to presentation were: cholesterol 142 mg/dL (normal <200 mg/dL), HDL 51 mg/dL (normal >40 mg/dL), triglycerides 101 mg/dL (normal <150 mg/dL), and a calculated LDL 71 mg/dL (normal <129 mg/dL). A recommendation was given to start a GnRH agonist (leuprolide) to determine whether her testosterone production was gonadotropin-responsive. However, the patient did not start the GnRH agonist at that time for two reasons. First, the testosterone level had decreased somewhat on its own, though it was still quite elevated (160 ng/dL to 100 ng/dL). Second, the patient's health insurance, Medicare, would not cover the off-label use of the medication, and the patient could not afford an out-of-pocket cost of ~ $1000/month for the intramuscular depot injection of leuprolide.\nOver the next two years, the patient had a progression of her symptoms, including continued scalp hair loss requiring a wig, increased body and facial hair requiring daily shaving, increased body odor and libido, and a deepening of the voice. Several high-resolution transvaginal ultrasounds over these two years continued to demonstrate a grossly normal right ovary (1.7 cm x 0.5 cm) The left ovary was visualized on the most recent ultrasound, and was also grossly normal (1.7 cm x 0.5 cm). Total testosterone levels remained elevated up to 151 ng/dL (normal 8-60 ng/dL). Because the patient continued to be a high risk surgical candidate with no clear surgical target, the patient was referred back to the reproductive endocrinology clinic to reconsider medical management.\nAt the time of that appointment, her testosterone had increased to 187.4 ng/dL (normal 2.9-40.8 ng/dL) and free testosterone was 1.3 pg/mL (normal 0.14-1.72 pg/mL). The patient was started on 20 U (1 mg) of daily subcutaneous injection of leuprolide (~$300/month), which her husband helped her administer at home. Two weeks later, testosterone levels had normalized to 23.9 ng/dL, confirming gonadotropin-responsive testosterone secretion, most likely of ovarian etiology.\nUnfortunately, two months after starting leuprolide, the patient reported significant \"hot flashes\", difficulty sleeping, and feeling anxious and depressed. On laboratory evaluation, the total and free testosterone levels were suppressed to below assay range <2.5 ng/dL (normal 2.9-40.8 ng/dL) and <0.43 pg/mL (normal 0.14-1.72 pg/mL), respectively. The patient was advised to use half of an estradiol/norethindrone acetate patch twice weekly to relieve symptoms. However, her depressive symptoms and fatigue persisted even in the presence of add-back therapy, and given the high cost of the medication not covered by Medicare, the patient decided against pursuing further attempts at increasing progestin add-back therapy and discontinued the leuprolide one month later (three months after starting injections). At follow-up 2 weeks after discontinuing leuprolide, the patient's testosterone had increased slightly to 6.5 ng/dL (normal 2.9-40.8 ng/dL).\nHer lipid levels at this time were as follows: cholesterol 149 mg/dL (normal 100-199 mg/dL), HDL 39 mg/dL (normal 40-80 mg/dL), triglycerides 280 mg/dL (normal 35-150 mg/dL), and a calculated LDL 54 mg/dL (normal 50-129 mg/dL). The patient's hemoglobin A1c level was 6.4% (normal <6.0%); with the aim of lowering her glucose levels and potentially ameliorating the hirsutism, she was subsequently started on metformin. At the last check-in, six months after discontinuing leuprolide therapy, her testosterone level increased to 85.24 ng/dL (normal 14-76 ng/dL), and she reported still having to shave her chin, but not as frequently as in the past. She reported being generally in good spirits, although low on energy secondary to having been recently hospitalized for medical complications unrelated to the elevated testosterone.",

    "clinical_text": "A 10-year-old male patient, weighing 35 kg, with a previously healthy medical history and normal psychomotor development, was in grade 5, with good academic performance. The disease progression was documented in 2 separate periods.\nThe first period was characterized by the acute onset of fever (39.5 C) associated with an unknown infection for 3 days that resolved on its own, with no specific treatment. One day after the fever stopped, symptoms of poor communication, fatigue, lethargy, and drowsiness appeared. The onset of convulsions was marked by the rotation of the eyes in the direction of head motion, sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right, which developed into generalized convulsions, accompanied by a purple coloration, and the loss of consciousness. Each episode lasted 1 to 2 minutes, with urinary incontinence and lethargy after each episode.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital with an early diagnosis of suspected herpes encephalitis, and acyclovir treatment was started. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 cells/mm3, and protein and glucose levels were within the normal range. Microbiological tests for herpes simplex virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and bacteria cultures were performed and were negative. An anti-NMDAR autoantibody test performed on CSF was negative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were normal. The antinuclear antibody test of the blood was negative. The patient was diagnosed with probable autoimmune encephalitis with negative anti-NMDAR antibodies. Acyclovir was discontinued after 3 days. Methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg/day was started in the second week of disease and last for 5 days. Oxcarbazepine was started at 600 mg/day. The following week, the patient was treated with 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for 5 days, and antiepileptic drugs (600 mg/day oxcarbazepine and 100 mg/day topiramate) and 1 mg/kg prednisone were taken daily for 6 weeks. Electroencephalography (EEG) results showed local onset paroxysmal activity in the left hemisphere with inhibited background activity (Figures 1 and 2). Many types of localized seizures were observed, accompanied by confusion, loss of time orientation, amnesia, insomnia, symptoms of hyperactivity disorder, irritability, and abnormal movement disorder included twisted mouth, no autonomic dysfunction, speech dysfunction. Maintenance IVIG therapy, at 0.4 mg/kg each week was administered for 5 consecutive weeks, and the doses of oxcarbazepine and topiramate were gradually increased to 1050 and 200 mg/day, respectively, and 1 mg haloperidol at night and 500 mg/day levetiracetam were added. Convulsions ceased after 14 days, stopped a few days, then relapsed with a frequency of 3 to 4 attacks/week. At sixth to ninth week, cancer screening tests, including computed tomography (CT) chest scan, were normal. Normal abdominal ultrasound. The patient showed improvement in cognitive-behavioral disorder symptoms and memory recovery but remained hyperactive and easily agitated. After 2 months of inpatient treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital and continued outpatient treatment with antiepileptic drugs, including oxcarbazepine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and haloperidol.\nAt thirrd month, re-examination, and re-assessment, the patient continued to experience 1 to 2 seizure episodes/month, returned to school, played chess, and performed math. The patient scored 125 points (high IQ) on the Raven's Progressive Matrices intelligence quotient (IQ) test; 7/9 on the hyperactivity and 4/9 on the attention reduction scales of the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale; and 2/8 on the impulsivity, and displayed significantly reduced behavioral disturbances. The second brain MRI did not show any abnormalities. The symptoms, laboratory data, and treatment modalities for this period lasted for 19 weeks and are presented in Table 1.\nFive months after the disease onset, the recurrence of multiple seizures was observed, and the patient presented to the Children's Hospital 2. The results of CSF analysis showed 8 white blood cells/mm3 and normal protein and glucose levels. CSF and blood were examined using indirect immunofluorescence to detect 5 antibodies known to cause autoimmune encephalitis, including those against NMDAR, leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABABR), and AMPAR (Figure 3). The result was positive for the AMPAR antibody. The brain MRI was normal. EEG showed generalized paroxysmal epileptic activity in the left temporal lobe with abnormal slow-wave background activity. Cancer screening tests, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and an ultrasound of the abdomen, were normal. The patient was diagnosed with anti-AMPAR encephalitis. Autoimmune-induced local epilepsy was treated with 30 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone for 5 days, and the antiepileptic drug treatment was adjusted (increase oxcarbazepine to 1800 mg/day, reduced levetiracetam to 3000 mg/day, and maintained topiramate at 300 mg/day). The patient responded with a significant reduction in seizure frequency, experiencing occasional short seizures lasting for a few seconds, with no purpleness and improved behavioral disturbances. Test Raven IQ again showed high IQ (110 points). This progression lasted from weeks 20 to 30 (Table 1).",

Genetic analysis (performed by us) indicated that one allele of the alpha-L-iduronidase gene contains a mutation causing a common Q70X truncation in the enzyme amino acid sequence. Further studies (performed at Consorzio Genetica Moleculare Umana, Monza, Italy, supervised by Prof. Andrea Biondi and coordinated by Genzyme Co.) confirmed the presence of this allele and indicated that the second mutation is an in frame deletion of three base pairs (codon 349), resulting in the loss of aspartic acid residue (Delta349). The investigated MPS I patient suffered, between other symptoms characteristic for this disease, from frequent diarrhea or loose stools, often accompanied by vomiting. No obvious contacts with persons suffering from intestinal infections, including family members (who also had no documented chronic or often diarrhea), were noticed shortly before or during these episodes. During the most severe episodes of diarrhea, detailed microbiological analyses of stools were performed. The patient was never treated with antibiotics before stool collection, thus, results of microbiological assays were not affected by such a treatment. Bacterial, viral or fungal infections were detected in all these analyses (Table 1).\nIsolation and preliminary analyses for identification and characterization of bacteria, viruses and fungi were performed using S-F selenium, blood agar, CNA, McConkey, SS, XLD, Sabouraud, Kligler and Singer, and BHI media (purchased from Becton Dickinson, Biomed or Bimex). Detailed analyses were performed using biochemical assay kits ID GN 32 (BioMerieux), EN-COCCUStest (Lachema) and ATB ID 32 C (BioMerieux), and immunological tests (kits purchased from Immunomed and BioMarieux). The microbiological assays were performed according to the semi-quantitative method, described previously. Non-enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, strains of Enterococcus faecalis and small amounts of other bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae were considered as normal aerobic bacterial flora. Identification of enteropathogenic E. coli strains was performed using a specific latex-immunological assay (purchased from Biomex). In this assay, 10 randomly chosen E. coli colonies (classified on the basis of microbiological and biochemical tests described above) were streak onto nutrient agar plates, and following 18 h incubation at 35 C bacteria were tested immunologically using the Biomex kit. The O antigens (characteristic for enteropathogenic E. coli strains but not for other strains of this bacterium), were detectable in this assay, and corresponding strains, bearing particular antigens, were divided into following groups: group A (antigens O26, O55, O111, O127 and O142), group B (antigens O86, O119, O124, O125, O126 and O128) and group C (antigens O18, O25, O44 and O114).",

Although the patient underwent emergency trauma suturing, no imaging was performed, and no foreign objects were detected at that time. The wound healed well. About five months ago, an ulcer appeared on the right nasal root and gradually worsened to form a sinus tract. Computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses was performed at a district hospital, which showed a strip of dense shadow transversely running through the nasal bone, measuring 25 mm x 5 mm [Fig. 1a]. At the district hospital, the patient underwent the removal of intranasal FB, but only a part of the object that measuring 2 mm x 2 mm was taken out. The FB was glass. Postoperative CT showed that the glass FB broke into two pieces: the larger one pierced into the left orbit close to the eye and the rest remained in the nasal cavity [Fig. 1b]. The patient was referred to our hospital.\nExamination revealed two wounds longitudinally located on both sides of the nose. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20. Eyeball position and movement were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected the two FBs in the soft tissues behind the nasal bone and in the left orbit.\nThree-dimensional (3D) model preparation: Based on the patient's CT data, a 3D model was made at a scale of 1:1 that accurately recreated the shape and position of the FB in the left orbit [<PMC10155551_IJO-71-300-g002_a_1_2.webp>].

Her supine blood pressure was 120/50 mmHg and there was a harsh grade III holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. She had clinical and radiological signs of congestive cardiac failure.\nThe 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia (110 beats per minute), with 2 mm ST elevation in the anteroseptal leads (V 2-V 4) and a left anterior fascicular block. Serum troponin T level at admission was elevated (163 ng/L).\nTransthoracic echocardiography (Figures 1 and 2) revealed apical hypokinesis and an apical muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) measuring approximately 1.6 cm in diameter. She had features of moderate pulmonary hypertension, with an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 42 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness was within normal limits and there was no atrial dilatation. Left ventricular function was within normal limits with an estimated ejection fraction of 65%.

She was also considered unsuitable for cardiac surgery.\nFollowing discharge from hospital, patient complained of lethargy and breathlessness and developed a recurrence of cardiac failure. In view of her age and comorbidities as well as a reluctance to undergo open repair, the decision was made to perform percutaneous closure of the VSD. This was performed in delayed fashion 18 months after the patient's initial presentation, the rationale being that this would allow the edges of the defect to fibrose to optimise the landing zone and to let the patient stabilise from her recent hospital admissions.\nA 16 mm Amplatzer muscular VSD occlude device was deployed (Figures 3 and 4), with transesophageal echocardiography confirming good placement of the device with reduction in the degree of shunting. Left ventriculography demonstrated a small residual flow around the apical side of the device but this appeared to reduce with time. It was felt that device sizing was appropriate and this residual shunting was related to the irregular shape of the postinfarction defect and is likely to lessen with time as the disks become endothelialised.\nThe patient subsequently made a successful postprocedural recovery and is clinically well to date.",

She was counseled that patients under the age of 18 generally should not undergo predictive genetic testing when it will not change medical management, but that typically myoclonus-dystonia presents in childhood with most patients developing symptoms before the age of 20. There was a 1 in 2 chance that she passed the pathogenic variant to each daughter, but due to imprinting (silencing) of her maternal allele 95% of the time, there is only a 5% (1 in 20) chance that the pathogenic allele will be expressed if it was inherited. Thus, each daughter's individual risk of expressing the phenotype is 1 in 2 multiplied by 1 in 20, or 1 in 40 (2.5% chance). If the patient has a son, he will have the same risk of inheriting and expressing the phenotype as her daughters.

However, if the patient has a grandson with the pathogenic variant, his risk of passing on the variant to each of his children, her great-grandchildren, would be 1 in 2 (50%), and those who inherit the variant would be expected to be symptomatic because there is no paternal imprinting, and the paternal copy of the gene would be expressed. <PMC10453946_tohm-13-1-783-g2_undivided_1_1.webp> depicts and summarizes the counseling provided above as a concise genetics pearl for reference in the clinic.

She complained of having spontaneously expelled the fetus at home. Upon examination, her cervical os was noted to be open with active, moderate vaginal bleeding and retained placenta inside. She had a history of prior two cesarean sections and no medical problems. Her vital signs on admission were stable and hemoglobin was 11.6 mg/dL.\nShe was recommended a dilatation and curettage (D and C) procedure due to retained placenta. The patient was noted to have persistent, active bleeding which was unresponsive to uterine bimanual massage, oxytocin infusion, hemabate, and methergine. At that time, patient was also hypotensive and a decision was made to perform an exploratory laparotomy with possible hysterectomy. During laparotomy, placenta was found to be densely adherent to the lower uterine segment and posterior wall of the bladder. We amputated the uterus just above the lower uterine segment, due to great difficulty in separating bladder from the lower uterine segment and packed the cervix and lower uterine segment with Surgicel. The patient was noted to have diffuse oozing from the pedicles and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) was suspected. Methylene blue dye was used to ensure that bladder was intact. At this time, we terminated the procedure and the laparotomy site was closed. The patient received 6 units of packed blood and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma during this surgery, with a blood loss of 3000 cc. Post-operative coagulation profile was PT 18.95, APTT 40.3, Fibrinogen 135, Hemoglobin 10.9, and platelets of 61.\nThe patient was then carefully monitored in surgical intensive care unit and was also taken for a uterine artery embolization due to persistent bleeding. Overnight the patient received 6 units of packed blood, 4 units of frozen plasma, crystalloids, and albumin. \nNext morning, she still had moderate vaginal bleeding with labile vital signs. Her DIC was noted to be more under control. We decided to perform a reexploration at that time. During this second surgery, residual lower uterine segment and cervix were noted to be enlarged, with active bleeding. We sharply separated the bladder from the lower uterine segment, followed by careful resection of the lower uterine segment and the cervix. Excellent hemostasis was ensured. Bladder integrity was confirmed with indigo carmine dye test resulting in no dye extravasation. The estimated blood loss was 5700 cc during this second surgery. Her postop course remained uneventful. She was discharged home on postoperative day 6 without any complications. \nHistopathology showed placental villi extending deeply into and through the myometrium of the lower uterine segment, suggestive of placenta percreta in the lower uterine segment.",

On physical examination, the patient had a delayed skin turgor and was found to be 7% dehydration, tachypneic (66 breaths/min), normal blood pressure (110 mmHg), normal heart rate (138 beats/min), and a normal temperature (39.3 C). Serum biochemistry revealed high blood urea nitrogen (30.5 mg/dL; reference range, 8 to 26 mg/dL), elevated total protein (7.7 g/dL; reference range, 5.4 to 7.4 g/dL), hyperglobulinemia (4.6 g/dL; reference range, 2.3 to 4.4 g/dL), elevated alkaline phosphatase (177 U/L; reference range, 15 to 127 U/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (198 mg/L; reference range, 0 to 20 mg/L). Blood gas analysis showed hypokalemia (2.55 mmol/L; reference range, 4.0 to 5.4 mmol/L) and hyponatremia (134 mmol/L; reference range, 142 to 152 mmol/L). A complete blood count indicated leukocytosis (white blood cells, 27.3 K/muL; reference range, 6.0 to 17.0 K/muL).\nAbdominal ultrasonography revealed a 2.1 cm x 2.2 cm hypoechoic, homogeneous, marginal mass in the pyloric region of the stomach (<PMC11335634_fvets-11-1427218-g001_undivided_1_1.webp>). When including the wall thickening lesion around the mass, it measured 2.1 cm x 3.7 cm. Mesenteric echo enhancement was identified around the mass and the distance between the margins of the mass and the common bile duct opening was 0.8-1.2 cm. The mass was causing significant obstruction of the gastric lumen, resulting in gastric dilatation and retention of the intragastric contents. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the gastric mass was performed, and no significant cells were observed on cytology.\nComputed tomography revealed a focal, well-circumscribed, smoothly marginated mass in the pyloric antrum, which did not show contrast enhancement (Figure 2). On computed tomography and abdominal ultrasonography, the lesion was suspected to be a mass in the pyloric antrum, and the differential diagnoses included leiomyoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), granuloma, polyp, and malignant tumor. The patient exhibited severe clinical symptoms due to pyloric obstruction. As a result, a surgical approach was considered.\nPylorectomy and gastroduodenostomy were performed. The patient was pre-medicated with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl (0.2 mg/kg and 0.002 mg/kg, respectively), followed by induction of anesthesia with propofol (6 mg/kg, intravenously). Subsequently, endotracheal intubation was performed and anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane in oxygen. A ventral midline abdominal incision was made from the xiphoid to the umbilicus. The greater and lesser omentum and portal triad of the gastroduodenal junction were isolated, and a mass was identified in the pyloric antrum (<PMC11335634_fvets-11-1427218-g003_A_1_2.webp><PMC11335634_fvets-11-1427218-g003_B_2_2.webp>). Stay sutures were placed in the upper section of the duodenum and pyloric antrum using polydioxanone (PDS II) 3 to 0. The gastric wall of the pyloric region was resected using an articulating stapler (Endo GIA; Medtronic Plc, Dublin, Ireland). Duodenal resection was performed using Metzenbaum scissors and Doyen intestinal forceps, followed by stomach anastomosis. To increase the gastric emptying time and minimize dumping syndrome, anastomosis was performed on the dorsal plane of the stomach. The abdominal cavity was lavaged with warm saline before closure. The abdomen was routinely closed. For postoperative management, a jejunal feeding tube (Nasogastric Feeding tube 6Fr x 90 cm; Mila Inc., Kentucky, Ireland) and an active suction drain (Jackson Pratt, Primed, Ireland) were placed.\nHistopathological examination of the pyloric mass revealed a gastric mural abscess containing foreign crystalline material. A circumscribed mass-like area with abundant necrosis and numerous degenerate neutrophils was observed in the stomach walls (Figure 4A). Additionally, multifocal, thin, smooth, sharply delineated, refractile appearing eosinophilic to orange, angular fragments indicative of crystalline foreign materials were identified within the lesion (Figure 4B). The mucosal surface was lined with mildly hyperplastic epithelium.\nPostoperative medications included maropitant (1 mg/kg, intravenously, q24h), esomeprazole (1 mg/kg, intravenously, q12h), ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously, q12h), metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously, q12h), marbofloxacin (2 mg/kg, intravenously, q24h), metronidazole (10 mg/kg, intravenously, q12h), ampicillin-sulbactam (22 mg/kg, intravenously, q8h), and sodium alginate (1 cc/kg, orally, q12h). Pain management was achieved through a constant-rate fentanyl infusion at 0.02ug/kg/min.\nNutritional support was carefully managed post-surgery due to the potential risk of complications. Feeding was initiated 24 h post-surgery via a jejunal tube. Initially, a liquid diet amounting to a quarter of the patient's resting energy requirements (RER) was administered in six divided doses per day. On the second postoperative day, the amount was increased to half of the RER. On the third postoperative day, feeding was transitioned to a nasogastric feeding tube, delivering the full RER in four divided doses per day. On the fourth day of admission, the patient had recovered voluntary appetite and was fed a wet diet at 1.3 times the RER. Throughout hospitalization, no gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or regurgitation were observed, allowing for a gradual increase in nutritional support. The exudate from the active suction drain gradually decreased and was subsequently removed. With no observed complications, the patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. The patient recovered well after discharge, showing no clinical symptoms. Abdominal ultrasonography follow-up on postoperative day 21 showed resolution of gastric retention and no abnormal findings in the anastomotic region. At 13 months postoperatively, a telephone follow-up with the owner indicated that there was no recurrence of clinical signs.",

On further probe on his childhood history, his mother reported that he was born normally at home by a Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) in one of the Internally Displaced peoples (IDP) camps in 2000. She reported that there was an uneventful pregnancy which was carried to term and delivery by Spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD). She reported that during her pregnancy, she had exclusive feeding on the relief food provided by WFP (beans, yellow posho and cooking oil) during the IDP camps and denies history of ingestion of herbs or medications which caused adverse events during and after the pregnancy. She reported that her child had a normal physical, cognitive and social childhood development before the onset of nodding which began in May 27th 2011 immediately after returning home from IDP camps. The child was enrolled in Atanga treatment centre and was being managed with Carbamazepine, multivitamins and Ivermectin. She reported that in spite of these medications the child continued to have seizures and nodding at least twice a day and had since dropped out of school.\nOn general examination, he was dehydrated, febrile and moderately wasted. There was a right lumbar region mass, tender, indurated and non-fluctuant. The spleen and liver were not palpable. There was no renal or supra-pubic tenderness. The rectum was full of faecal material which was of normal colour and consistency. The anal tone was normal and there was no blood on examining fingure. Haematological investigations were conducted and showed neutrophilia, lympocytosis, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. There were immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral film report. Other laboratory results including liver function tests (ALT, AST) were elevated while serum protein levels were low; renal functions tests (serum creatinine, blood urea and nitrogen level), and serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Cl-, HC03-) which were within normal ranges (Figure 1). Abdominal Ultrasound showed inflamed internal and external oblique muscles of the anterior abdominal wall.\nThe patient underwent incision and drainage at Gulu Hospital and wound left open for 14days and thereafter secondary wound closure was conducted. He received supplementary food rehabilitation and his seizure medication was changed to Sodium Valproate 200mg once a day under direct observation therapy (DOTS) and close monitoring of the vital signs. The patient continued to have regular follow up in the surgical ward; seizures and nodding stopped completely from the time of intervention in the hospital. With these interventions for over one month the child had no seizures nor nodding and the child returned to normal life. A subsequent review of the haematological and clinical chemistry findings 2 weeks later showed that renal function tests, serum electrolytes were normal except the liver enzymes level were elevated and were still high (table 1).",

    "clinical_text": "The index was a female teenager referred by the general practitioner to the pediatrician at the age of 14 with fatigue complaints. Physical examination and general laboratory analysis were unremarkable. Her periods were regular, and there were no cardiac or respiratory abnormalities. A year later, she was again referred by the general practitioner to a consultant of pediatric infectious diseases and clinical immunology after three pneumonias with fever and cough complaints, all of which responded well to antibiotics. All sputum cultures remained negative. Blood tests yielded normal results for sedimentation, CRP, blood count and differentiation, and liver and kidney function. There was a normal TSH value. The IgA was absent (<0.04 g/l), the IgG (4.6 g/l) was low, and the IgM (0.31 g/l) was low-normal. EBV and CMV serology were IgG negative. Vaccination responses against the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) vaccine and the protein component tetanus toxoid (TetTox) were determined, and both vaccination responses were reduced (Table 1). There was no IgG detectable against live-attenuated measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) despite previous immunization according to our national vaccination program at 14 months and 9 years of age. She had previously experienced chickenpox without clinical problems, with a positive VZV IgG serology. Within 6 months following the diagnostic vaccination studies, antibody levels dropped to almost undetectable levels: IgG 1.7 g/l and IgM 0.04 g/l, in the presence of normal CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers and NK-cell numbers, but a markedly reduced B-cell number. Taken together, following the pneumonias, hypogammaglobulinemia, and low response on pneumococcal vaccination, a definite diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) was made (; Table 2). Treatment with prophylactic antibiotics and immunoglobulin supplementation therapy (IVIG) was initiated with an IgG trough value above 6.0 g/l. Since that moment, the patient has been without infections.\nGiven the relatively young age of the index patient in combination with the described (\"uitgesproken\") clinical and immunological abnormalities, the family history was investigated. The parents of the index patient were unrelated. The father once had an Ig spectrum determined during screening of vaccination responses because of his frequent professional travels to tropical countries. He had a normal IgG and IgM but a complete IgA deficiency. He was without any complaints at all. His T, B, and NK cells were within the normal range (Table 1). The mother of the index patient was healthy, and no immunological abnormalities were observed. The younger brother of the index patient had presented to our hospital 6 months before the referral of the index patient herself. He had a whooping cough and a mild thrombopenia upon a blood test. Antiplatelet autoantibodies were present, along with selective IgA deficiency. He was treated with azithromycin, and the cough slowly cleared over the following 2-3 months. However, during this follow-up, we diagnosed chronic idiopathic thrombopenia (cITP) because of persistent low platelet counts around 50 x 109/l:without any clinical bleeding tendency though, and normal vaccine reactivity against pneumococcal vaccine, tetanus vaccine, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",

On admission to receive TBLC, the vital signs of the patient were body temperature of 36.3 C, regular pulse of 75 bpm, SpO2 of 99% in room air, and auscultation for the heart and lungs was normal. He had been having dry cough for 3 months before bronchoscopic examination (the day X-3M) (<PMC11199689_fmed-11-1380236-g001_undivided_1_1.webp>), and painful swelling of the right knee and right wrist, and diffuse tiny scaly erythematous in abdomen, back and extremities of cutaneous with mild pigmentation, were accompanied with emergence of cough.\nLaboratory examination revealed a normal range of leukocytes (4800 cells/muL) and fraction of neutrophils (56%), eosinophils (2.9%), basophils (1.0%), monocytes (16.9%), and lymphocytes (23.2%), but elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (33.4 U/L), soluble interleukin 2 receptor (3440 U/ml), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (233 ng/ml). The electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block, spirometry showed a normal range of forced vital capacity (83.7%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (83.1%), and DLCO (84.6%). Chest X-rays and CT scans showed diffuse fine granular shadows extending into the bilateral lungs (Figures 2A-C) and minor swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes (Figure 2D).\nThe patient was treated with prednisolone (5-10 mg/day) and human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, adalimumab) at a dose of 40 mg once every two weeks, which was introduced 2 years ago to treat arthritis and reduce the adverse effects of steroids. Differential diagnosis for granular shadows in the bilateral lungs suggested fungal and acid-fast bacillus infections, drug-induced granulomatosis, lymphoma, vasculitis, and granulomas due to BS.\nBronchoscopy was performed on the lesions of the lung field and mediastinal lymph nodes on day X (<PMC11199689_fmed-11-1380236-g001_undivided_1_1.webp>). The lumen of the main bronchus showed reticulated dilation of the capillaries, appearing like sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from the left B5a, and 101/150 mL of lavage was recovered. The cell fraction of BALF was predominantly lymphocytes (87%), and the CD4/8 ratio was not elevated (0.97). Transbronchial needle biopsy (TBNA) was performed on longitudinal lymph nodes #7 and #2R, where access was feasible. TBLC was performed on right B8a, right B4a, and right B3a. In a previous report, granulomas from patients with BS displayed a distinct morphology characterized by large polycyclic granulomas with dense lymphocytic coronas, forming a large granulomatous complex without inter granulomatous sclerosis, indicating an exuberant chronic inflammatory response. In the present case, specimens obtained by TBLC were sufficiently large to observe complex of granulomas and inter granulomas, and those specimens showed non-caseating epithelioid granulomas scattered around the alveolar septum, bronchi, and vessels forming a large granulomatous complex without inter granulomatous sclerosis at low magnification (<PMC11199689_fmed-11-1380236-g003_A_1_2.webp>). At high magnification, prominent epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells around bronchioles were observed, similar to previous reports on polycyclic granuloma observed in lymph nodes or skin biopsy specimens from BS patients, but in the present case, they were not seen in granulomas with dense lymphocytic coronas (<PMC11199689_fmed-11-1380236-g003_B_2_2.webp>). TBNA specimens contained epithelioid cells. The cultures of cells obtained from saline for washing needle of TBNA and for probe of TBLC, BALF and an aspirated sputum sample through bronchoscopy did not reveal bacterial or fungus infections and mycobacterial infection by Ziehl-Neelsen stain and culture using mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) system. Based on clinical, hematological, and pathological findings, the lung lesions were diagnosed as pulmonary granulomas caused by BS. While an additional dose of prednisolone was considered for the therapy of cough and lung lesions, taking into account the lack of SpO2 decrease, the patient's young age, the increased risk of adverse effects from additional prednisolone, the absence of infection and also the possibility of spontaneous resolution of granulomatous lesions, the patient was followed up for 2 months without escalating dose of prednisolone or additional immunosuppressant. Celecoxib, a cox-2 inhibitor, was additionally administered for arthralgia of the knees and wrists, and arthralgia was alleviated. Cough gradually decreased spontaneously subsequent two months (X+2M), and chest X-ray also showed a slight improving. However, after four months form bronchoscopic examination (X+4M), right knee and right wrist, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint pain and metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint pain were aggravated again. Since chief complaint of the patient was joint pain and prednisolone and methotrexate (MTX) and/or azathioprine were recommended for pulmonary sarcoidosis, MTX 4mg/2weeks was started for the arthralgia. The dose was subsequently increased, and pain was under control. No adverse effects due to MTX have appeared. Despite worsening arthralgia on the day X+4, cough and the lung lesions have remained without recurrence, and those were no subsequent deterioration. Changes in serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels appeared to reflect well the manifestation of cough and lung lesions and their subsequent resolution (<PMC11199689_fmed-11-1380236-g001_undivided_1_1.webp>).",

    "description": "A 30-year-old schizophrenic female with a history of NMS presents with toothache, severe xerostomia, and widespread dental caries after discontinuing antipsychotic medications.",
    "clinical_text": "A 30-year-old schizophrenic patient decided to visit the dentist office because of a toothache. The patient complained of burning sensation and dryness in her mouth and sleep disturbances. One week prior to the visit, the patient had stopped taking antipsychotic drugs prescribed by a psychiatrist, which she had taken at the following doses: aripiprazole 30 mg/day, perazine 100 mg/day, and carbamazepine 800 mg/day. She admitted to having taken the drugs irregularly. The patient either discontinued the treatment for several days or had taken double doses on subsequent days 'to feel better faster'. The patient had poor insight into the illness, did not see a need for regular treatment of schizophrenia, and reported depressive mood caused by 'chips in the teeth'. She had a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome caused by risperidone treatment, therefore she was unwilling to take antipsychotic drugs, or she reduced the dosage by herself, being afraid of adverse events. During oral cavity and dental examination at the dentist office, the patient was diagnosed with circular and root caries, thick dental plaque, oral mucositis in the form of ulcerations, mucosal redness and dryness, as well as spontaneous mucosal lacerations. Food residues were also detected. Silness-Loe plaque index (PI) amounted to 2.29 and approximal plaque index (API) by Lange was 100%. It was also found that her tongue tended to stick to the palate due to saliva hyposecretion. This condition caused difficulties in eating and bolus forming, affected her taste perception, and resulted in oversensitivity to the temperature of drunk liquids, as well as reduced appetite. In addition, the patient complained of halitosis (fetor ex ore), speaking difficulties, as well as throat dryness and soreness. The patient underwent sialometry which measured stimulated and unstimulated saliva secretion. Saliva hyposecretion was diagnosed, and it amounted to 0.5 ml/min following unstimulated saliva secretion and to 0.7 ml/min following stimulated saliva secretion (chewing of a gum). Unstimulated and stimulated saliva secretion was tested threefold within 6 min, 2 h after breakfast. With regards to numerous conditions concerning the patient's dentition, she received periodontal treatment. The treatment involved supra- and subgingival plaque deposits removal (scaling) together with periodontal pocket irrigation and root debridement in order to reduce plaque deposits (bacterial biofilm) and to accelerate the cell healing process. An invasive treatment involved teeth 16, 17, and 33 with third degree root caries, tooth 26 with fourth degree caries, and due to esthetic reasons, tooth 43 with second degree root caries. Third degree dental caries were processed and filled with glass-ionomer cement (Ketac Molar , 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). For a deep cavity of tooth 26, an additional self-hardening calcium hydroxide base (Life , Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA, USA) was used. For esthetic reasons, caries on labial surfaces of teeth 33 and 43 were filled with complex material using the sandwich technique (Herculite , Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA, USA). Following the treatment, the exposed root surfaces of all the teeth were covered with 35% CHX varnish (EC40  Biodent , Certichem, Nijmenen, Netherlands) for preventive reasons. Afterwards, the patient was once more instructed how to keep good oral cavity hygiene and how to perform routine oral hygiene activities correctly. It was recommended that the patient precisely remove food residues and dental plaque with the use of a nonabrasive fluoride toothpaste (Elmex, Colgate GABA Therwill, Switzerland) after each meal, and rinse her mouth with alcohol-free mouthwashes containing 0.1% chlorhexidine (Eludril Classic, Pierre Fabre Medicament, Warsaw, Poland). For xerostomia treatment, a pilocarpine-based formulation was applied with splitting daily dosage of 10 mg/day. During policarpine treatment, the patient was instructed to drink more liquids, in the amount of 2 l/day, to prevent from drug-induced dehydration. Following policarpine treatment and full recovery from the oral infection and dental caries, it was recommended that the patient applies artificial saliva based on mucin, carboxymethylcellulose, and glycerine. In addition to periodontal treatment, the patient underwent psychiatric treatment and participated in psychoeducation on schizophrenia. Psychiatric treatment involved administering olanzapine at a dose of 25 mg/day, which allowed for improvement in patient's mental health. The psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) ceased, and cognitive functions returned to normal. The patient underwent individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and participated in psychoeducation. After 4 weeks, the patient had her oral hygiene status once more examined with the use of the indexes previously applied. Silness-Loe plaque index amounted to 0.58 and approximal plaque index to 23%, which indicated significant dental plaque reduction. After 12 weeks, all the teeth were covered again with 35% CHX varnish (EC40  Biodent , Certichem, Nijmenen, Netherlands). The amount of Streptococcus mutant was significantly decreased in saliva and dental plaque. Effectiveness of EC40 was confirmed by the direct contact test (DCT) (Nunclon Delta Surface; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). The DCT was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the CHX varnishes.\nWith regular dental visits, continuous psychiatric care and participation in psychoeducation, the patient regained control over her health status and did not feel anxious about the therapy any more. The patient started compliance with the doctors and began to visit her dentist, psychiatrist, and psychologist on a regular basis.",

She visited a local hospital for head computed tomography (CT) and self-reported that the results were not significantly abnormal. Ten days before admission, she noticed decreased visual acuity in the right eye with a yellowish purulent discharge. Therefore, she visited an ophthalmic hospital. Intraocular pressure was 31 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left eye. Ocular ultrasound showed vitreous organic substances in the right eye and vitreous opacity in the left eye. Then, she visited the general hospital for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no obvious abnormalities and only multiple polyps in the gallbladder. After that, she visited the ophthalmic hospital again, and 202.90 mg/L C-reactive protein (CRP) was tested. CT results suggested multiple nodules in the right lung and a mass shadow in the right lobe of the liver. In addition, this patient underwent \"vitrectomy in the right eye, lens phacoemulsification, and silicone oil injection\" seven days before admission. During the surgery, large areas of retinal necrosis were observed in the right eye. After the surgery, the right eye swelling and pain of the patient were aggravated, accompanied by a foreign body sensation and increased yellowish purulent eye discharge. The culture of eye discharge showed Kp ++++ (detailed drug sensitivity test results are shown in Table 1). Postoperative blood routine examination exhibited 15.53 x 109/L leukocytes, 90% neutrophils, 122 g/L hemoglobin, 54.00 x 109/L platelets, and 98.47 mg/L CRP. One day before admission, the patient had a fever of up to 37.8 C with chills and vomited once (the vomitus was stomach contents). The routine urine examination during the fever demonstrated glucose 4 +, urinary ketone 1 +, urine occult blood +, and yeast-like fungi +. Later, the patient was admitted to our department for further diagnosis and treatment. This patient has had diabetes for 2 years, but her glycemic control is poor because she does not take \"metformin and glibenclamide\" regularly.. Over 20 days before admission, she developed gross hematuria without fever and painful, urgent, or frequent urination after four intermittent enemas in the beauty parlor, which were not diagnosed and treated. Hematuria disappeared after approximately 5 days. This patient denied a history of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease.\nAfter admission, all immune markers were measured, which illustrated 1730.00 mg/dL immunoglobulin G and no abnormalities in other markers. In addition, no obvious abnormality was observed in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Two blood cultures both showed no bacterial growth. Fecal culture results were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, 25%; yeast-like fungi, 25%; and Escherichia coli, 50%. The results of other tests including routine biochemical test are presented in Table 2. Echocardiography showed no valve excrescences. On the 5th day after admission, the three-phase enhanced CT of the whole abdomen suggested liver abscess and embolus formation of the right hepatic vein (Figure 1). In abdominal color ultrasound, no abnormalities were observed in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen. On the 16th day after admission, abdominal enhanced CT displayed that the size of the abscess in the right lobe of the liver was 3.4 cm, which was smaller than before (Figure 2). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head displayed multiple mini-brain abscesses (Figure 3). Ocular MRI indicated inflammatory lesions around the right eye ring and changes consistent with postoperative changes in the right eye (Figure 3).\nBased on her medical history and laboratory test results, the patient was diagnosed with liver abscess, endophthalmitis (the right eye), and brain abscesses. After admission, the patient was successively intravenously injected with 1 g meropenem (q8 h) for 1 day and with 1 g meropenem (q8 h) combined with 50 mg tigecycline (q12 h; the initial dose was doubled; anti-infection therapy) for 2 days. Nevertheless, the temperature of the patient was poorly controlled; therefore, antibiotic treatment was adjusted. Specifically, she was given intravenous injection of 1 g imipenem/cilastatin (q8 h) combined with 50 mg tigecycline (q12 h) for 5 days and anti-infection treatment of 200 mg etimicin (qd8) combined with 2 g Moxalactam (q12 h) for 17 days, supplemented by symptomatic treatment such as blood sugar control, anticoagulation, and local antibiotics for the eye. After treatment, the temperature and inflammatory indicators, such as hemogram, CRP, and procalcitonin (PCT) of the patient decreased (Figures 4 and 5). The re-examination of the abdomen with enhanced CT revealed that the abscess was smaller than before. The patient was discharged with medicine after her condition improved. The patient had no fever and was generally well. After discharge, the right eyeball was removed in the ophthalmic hospital.",

    "clinical_text": "About 2 years ago a 5-year-old girl with recurrent urinary infection was admitted in another hospital and checked. A 2  grade active right vesicoureteral reflux was found by voiding cystourethrography. She was treated by assuming orally a long-term antibacterial therapy: a prophylactic evening dose of trimethoprim-sulfa combination. After one year vesicoureteral reflux remained unchanged by X-ray check and she had a urinary infection relapse for a temporary break in antibacterial therapy. The parents took her to another urological department and were advised to submit their daughter to ureteral reimplantation surgery.\nThey were not persuaded and took their little girl to our outpatients' department.\nShe was a little girl presenting normal somatic characteristic for her age, quite shy and affectively deeply attached and dependent from her mother who accompanied her. Her physical objectivity did not signal anything which could lead to urological pathologies. Looking at the cystourethrography (Figure 1) we observed a large vesical capacity, abnormal for the patient's age; an ultrasound exam of the urinary tract confirmed this observation: her bladder contained a volume of 500 cc.\nThe girl seemed calm with no need of urinating. Finally, persuaded by her mother she had an uroflowmetry test; the girl completely emptied her bladder, urinated 500 mL, with a normal flow.\nSearching in the remote pathological anamnesis we found that the girl had always urinated rarely, twice or three times a day, remaining sometimes for more than 12 hours without urinating.\nShe had often refused to urinate in the evening before going to sleep, saying she did not need to.\nHer mother did not attribute any importance to this habit and she did not insist. In both of them it was clear a fear of urinating in bathrooms out of their home because of the scarce hygiene conditions and the past urinary infections of the girl.\nThe patient refused every kind of invasive diagnostic approach such as urodynamic examination, cystoscopy. We could proceed in the diagnosis only by asking a micturition diary which has confirmed our clinical suspect of Lazy Bladder Syndrome.\nFrom a therapeutic point of view, the girl has been directed to a bladder training therapy.\nWe only used behavioral therapy notifying to the girl a strict daily micturition scheme to modify the child's voiding habit and achieve a different behavior which included more frequent micturition and a new conception of the use of public toilettes. Consulting did not prescribe any other approach considering the good level of cooperation of the girl.\nThe absence of evident postmicturition residuals enabled us to avoid anticolinergic-alpha-adrenergic blockade therapies or invasive procedures such as intermittent catheterization or endovesical electrical stimulation.\nAfter 9-month follow-up the patient seems to have changed her micturition habits; she is still following a prophylactic antibacterical therapy.\nThe last ultrasonographic evaluation does not show any negative evidence of the upper urinary tract.\nThe cystography check done 9 months later than the previous one and after 6 months of behavioral therapy pointed out the disappearance of the vesicouretheral reflux.",

She was discharged with a maintenance immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone.\nApproximately 2 months posttransplant, the patient developed fever measuring 38.4 C and left lower quadrant abdominal pain over the renal allograft. Upon presentation to the emergency department, her blood pressure was 131/64 mmHg and her heart rate was 63 bpm. Her white blood cell count on admission was 11.7 x 109 cells per litre and was predominantly neutrophils. Her creatinine was 134 mumol/L which was essentially unchanged from her baseline. She endorsed some nausea and mild left-sided flank pain. She did not report any dysuria, gross hematuria, or increased urinary frequency. Her physical examination was significant for left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. She was initially treated empirically with meropenem 500 mg IV q 8 h, given her history of ESBL-producing E. coli bacteriuria. Her fever resolved shortly after starting antibiotics. An abdominal CT scan showed inflammatory changes around the transplanted kidney that were suggestive of an infection rather than allograft rejection.\nHer initial urine culture grew <10 x 106 CFU/L of mixed enteric flora, but her imaging and clinical presentation were most in keeping with a urinary source. The blood culture signaled positive in 1 bottle after 16 hours. The initial gram stain showed Gram-negative bacilli resembling coliforms, and later, the isolate was identified as K. variicola by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics; Germany version 4.1 DB-7854). After a day of treatment with meropenem, her therapy was narrowed based on culture results to ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily. She continued to be afebrile, her white blood cell count normalized, and her pain gradually improved following 2 days of ceftriaxone. She was subsequently switched to ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily and discharged from the hospital. Her creatinine and GFR remained stable throughout her admission. She continued this treatment to complete a 14-day total course of antibiotics.",

She was recommended to undergo mastectomy but refused it. After refusing to receive any treatment for the tumor for 3 years, she was eventually hospitalized at a university hospital located in Seoul due to severe back pain, jaundice, and ascites. The PET-CT examination performed on October 19, 2015, showed right breast cancer and metastases in the liver, mesentery, retroperitoneum, both pelvic bones, cranium, whole-body bone, as well as pleural effusion and ascites. Due to the extreme probability of whole-body fractures as a result of multiple bone metastases, the patient was maintained in absolute bed rest. The biopsy results for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 were +, -, and 3+, respectively. After chemo-port insertion, on October 28, 2015, first-line trastuzumab and paclitaxel treatment was performed by using palliative chemotherapy, followed by ascites and pleural effusion puncture. However, the chemo-port was removed due to port infection. From November 2, 2015, the patient began Korean medicine therapy after she was prescribed oral herbal medicine at Soram Korean Medicine Hospital. On November 20, 2015, second-line therapy was carried out with only trastuzumab, and, from December 13 to December 24, 2015, vancomycin and tazoperan were administered to treat gram-positive and gram-negative sepsis. Abdominal CT and bone scan performed on December 28, 2015, showed a reduction of multiple liver metastases in comparison to the previous result. However, it seemed to be combined with contraction of the liver parenchyma, and ascites and peritoneum metastasis were still visible. Pleural effusion on both sides increased, and, despite a slight decrease of bone metastases in some areas, new lesions were found on the sternum, left third and fourth ribs, and right acetabulum. After third-line chemotherapy with trastuzumab and paclitaxel on December 30, 2015, the patient was found to have VRE and gave up chemotherapy. Later, from January 22, 2016, to August 8, 2016, the patient received only Korean medicine therapy, which was evaluated based on CT and PET-CT performed at the university hospital where she had previously received chemotherapy. The abdominal CT image on May 30, 2016, showed a noticeable reduction of the liver metastasis lesion as well as scar and contraction of the liver parenchyma. Bone metastasis was still present. When compared to the test carried out on October 19, 2015, the PET-CT result on August 8, 2016, showed a significant reduction of the tumor size in the right breast, the primary site of the tumor, as well as of the right axillary lymph node, liver, and bone metastases. However, on the right adrenal gland, a possible new metastatic tumor appeared (Table 1; Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3).\nThe Korean medicine therapy provided to the patient between November 2, 2015, and August 8, 2016, was based on oral administration of wild ginseng pharmacopuncture (WGP), distilled Soramdan S, Hae, and Jeobgoldan. WGP was used every day or every other day, while Soramdan S and Hae were administered every day or 3 times per week. Jeobgoldan was administered twice per day.",

The echocardiogram indicated an estimated left atrial volume index of 30 mL/m2 and an ejection fraction of 63%. Further assessment via transoesophageal echocardiography revealed no thrombus in both the left atrium and left atrial appendage. Additionally, we conducted preoperative left atrial computed tomography angiography to obtain early insights into the left atrial structure. The results revealed a common ostium of the left and right inferior pulmonary veins. (Figure 2A,B).

In his history, the pregnancy period of the patient's mother was reported to be trouble-free, but since adequate information could not be obtained, it is not known whether virilization during pregnancy developed or not. The pedigree of the patient is shown in <PMC3701920_JCRPE-5-129-g2_undivided_1_1.webp>. The patient was born by normal vaginal delivery with a normal birth weight in the 39th week of pregnancy. His development was reported to be normal during childhood and at puberty. First, a right forearm fracture developed after minimal trauma at age 15, and later, right and left forearm fractures occurred with minimal trauma at ages 19 and 24. A left forearm radiography performed at age 24 showed osteopenia, and the epiphyses were detected to be open. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made based on bone densitometry performed in the medical facility to which he applied at age 26 with the complaint of pain in the bones, and alendronate 70 mg/week was started. After nearly one year of treatment, due to the progression of osteoporosis and progressive increase in height noted on follow-up, the patient was referred to our center for further evaluation. In his family history, the mother and father were first-degree cousins and he had two brothers. There was no infertility, primary amenorrhea, or hirsutism history in the family, but there was a history of kidney stones in two babies (relatives) who died in their early infancy (1-2 week). Our patient was born with ambiguous genitalia.\nOn physical examination, blood pressure was 125/75 mmHg, pulse rate 79/minute. His height was 187 cm (height of mother: 155 cm, height of father: 176 cm; target height: 172 cm). His weight was 90 kg, and body mass index was 25.7. Waist circumference was 102 cm, stroke distance 200 cm, ratio of upper part of body to lower body 0.85. A eunuchoid body habitus was noted. Secondary sexual characteristics were normal. The length and thickness of the penis was normal. Testicular volume, measured with an orchidometer, was >20 mL. No gynecomastia, goitre, acanthosis nigricans, or acromegalic appearance were noted.\nResults of laboratory tests are presented in Table 1. As will be noted, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were above normal; testosterone level was normal, while estrogen was undetectable. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, 17 hydroxyprogesterone, parathyroid hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels were all normal. Growth hormone basal level was 0.32 ng/mL. Following glucose loading for the oral glucose tolerance test, growth hormone level was 0.25 ng/mL. Insulin-like growth factor-1 level was 332 ng/mL (normal ranges for this age: 93-575 ng/mL). Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were high; serum HDL concentration was low. Fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test yielded normal values. In semen analysis, sperm count was 56 million/mm with 40% motility. In liver ultrasonography, grade one hepatosteatosis was detected. Karyotype analysis showed a 46,XY pattern.\nPlain bone radiography of the left wrist and hand demonstrated open metacarpal and phalangeal epiphyses, and the bone age was estimated as 15 years (<PMC3701920_JCRPE-5-129-g3_undivided_1_1.webp>). Bone densitometer revealed osteoporosis at the lumbar region (L1-L4 T score - 3.68, Z score - 3.68).\nGenetic analysis was performed in the genetics laboratories of Ege University Faculty of Medicine. A homozygous R375H guanine-adenine (G-A) mutation was detected in the CYP19A1 gene (Figure 3a). The genetic analysis of the family members revealed a homozygous R375H G-A mutation in the younger brother and heterozygous R375H G-A mutation in the mother, father, and older brother (Figure 3b).\nAfter the patient and his relatives were informed about the disease, 25 microg transdermal estradiol was started once in every three days. In the third month of the treatment, FSH, LH, and testosterone levels were found to be decreased. There was also a notable decrease in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and an increase in HDL level. An increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels were also detected.",

This patient showed persistent post-operative PSA and was treated with prostatic fossa radiation at the age of 56. Records for the initial prostate cancer staging and radiation therapy were unavailable, as they were performed 22 years prior to presentation. Patient 2's PSA stabilized but never became undetectable. At 71 years of age, patient 2's PSA increased, and at this time, leuprolide was started. An 18F-fluciclovine PET showed an avid mass in the prostatectomy bed inseparable from the left inferior bladder wall. Darolutamide was started when the patient was 73 years old due to rising PSA, suggesting castration resistance with associated posterior bladder thickening on the ultrasound. 18F-fluciclovine PET and prostate MRI at the age of 75 showed an enlarging 18F-fluciclovine-avid posterior bladder mass. Biopsy of the mass showed a Gleason Score of 4 + 5 = 9 prostate adenocarcinoma. A 68Ga-prostatic specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET showed uptake in the prostatectomy bed, but no other areas of focal uptake. A cystoscopy did not show an intraluminal lesion or stricture. After a multi-disciplinary discussion with urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists, re-irradiation of the prostatic fossa recurrent mass with SAbR was recommended given castration resistance, time from prior radiation therapy, and concern for morbidity of further progression in the prostatic fossa mass. The patient was treated with MRgRT, with 35 Gy in five fractions delivered twice per week ( Figure 2 ). No acute toxicity was experienced during treatment or at the 2-month follow-up. He continued his ADT/darolutamide and his most recent post-SAbR PSA 5 months after therapy decreased to 0.09.\nPatient 3 was diagnosed at the age of 53 with low-risk prostate cancer: T1cN0, Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6, and an initial PSA of 9.26. He underwent conventionally fractionated external beam radiation of the prostate and seminal vesicles, 79.2 Gy in 44 fraction, and PSA nadir was 0.64. He met the Phoenix criteria at age 60, with PSA 2.75 prompting 18F-fluciclovine PET, which showed uptake in the left mid/base of the prostate. MRI of the prostate showed a 22 cc gland with a PIRADS 5 lesion on the left crossing midline with evidence of seminal vesicle invasion and extraprostatic extension. Template and lesion-directed MRI-guided biopsies showed Gleason score 4 + 5 = 9 prostate cancer in 4/14 cores with a total of 7/14 cores positive for > Gleason score 7 prostate cancer. He was not deemed to be a surgical candidate, and thus, he started leuprolide and bicalutamide 2 months after biopsy and, after medical oncology evaluation, started abiraterone and prednisone 3 months after biopsy with subsequent castrate testosterone and undetectable PSA. He chose to undergo MRgRT SAbR 5 months after biopsy; he was treated with RT directed at left SV and left mid-base crossing midline to 34 Gy in five fractions with SIB of gross disease to 40 Gy in five fractions ( Figure 3 ). He reported no acute toxicity and continued to have an undetectable PSA post-SAbR.\nPatient 4 was diagnosed at the age of 61 with high-risk localized prostate cancer: T2cN0, a Gleason Score of 4 + 3 = 7, and an initial PSA of 51.02. He underwent pelvic and prostate radiation therapy with 45 Gy in 25 fractions to his pelvis, and 79.2 Gy in 44 fractions to his prostate and seminal vesicles along with 2 years of concurrent androgen deprivation with leuprolide. The patient's PSA reached a nadir of 0.18, and his PSA began to slowly rise, causing him to meet the Phoenix criteria for failure at age 69. An F18-fluciclovine PET/CT revealed a focus of uptake in his seminal vesicle adjacent to the posterior wall of the bladder. MRI revealed a diffusion-restricted lesion in the right vas deferens at the junction of the seminal vesicle corresponding to the site of uptake on PET/CT. He underwent salvage treatment with once weekly SAbR ART (Ethos, Varian), 40 Gy delivered in five fractions of 8 Gy to the seminal vesicles. Adaptation was used in two of the five fractions to prioritize rectal dose, with a decrease in rectal D50% by 5%-7% and Dmax by 4%-5%. V40Gy coverage was more than 91% of the PTV for each of the delivered plans and congruent with the initial planning of 92% V40Gy.  Figure 4  demonstrates a representative sagittal comparison of the scheduled and adapted plan, with the improved dose homogeneity visually apparent in addition to the coverage of the target anteriorly with a decreased posterior extent of the 650 cGy line. No acute toxicity was experienced during treatment or at the 2-month follow-up. He received no concurrent or adjuvant systemic therapy. He had a robust response in PSA that decreased to 1.02, 3 months post-SAbR.\nPatient 5 was diagnosed at the age of 58 with favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer: T1cN0, a Gleason Score of 3 + 4 = 7, and an initial PSA of 5.4. He underwent I-125 brachytherapy seed placement with initial improvement. He had a rising PSA but no identified focus and was started on long-term androgen deprivation with bicalutamide and dutasteride at which point he transferred care to our institution. His PSA nadir was 0.3 on ADT 10 years after initial RT and was generally stable on long-term bicalutamide, but started to have a slowly rising PSA over the next 6 years. At age 74, the patient's PSA reached 3.0 and he underwent F18-fluciclovine PET/CT, revealing a focus of intense uptake in the left-sided root of the penis/perirectal space. MRI showed a 1.7-cm lesion along the left lower anterior rectal wall abutting the penile bulb, caudal to his I-125 seeds. A biopsy confirmed prostate cancer recurrence and a Gleason Score of 4 + 4 = 8. He received weekly SAbR ART treatment of 30 Gy in five fractions to the PTV with a SIB boost of 35 Gy to the GTV ( Figure 5 ). Adaptation was used in all five fractions to improve coverage of the target. Thirty Gray PTV coverage was improved from approximately 96% to over 97%, while 35 Gy PTV was consistently improved from 80% to 90% to approximately 93% coverage, both approaching simulated V30Gy 99% and V35Gy 94% with rectal Dmax 3% lower with adaptation. This target was somewhat deformable due to bowel gas, thus lending well to adaptation. However, bowel gas caused significant artifacts on the cone beam CT; therefore, we used the implanted brachytherapy seeds as markers to help delineate caudal/cranial borders of the treatment field. The patient had rectal urgency after the third fraction during treatment, but this was resolved by the 2-month follow-up. He was started on abiraterone soon after starting SAbR. His PSA improved post-SAbR but was still detectable after treatment, prompting a repeat F18-fluciclovine PET 7 months post-SAbR, which showed an interval decrease in radiotracer uptake in the irradiated disease without another obvious site of disease.",

    "clinical_text": "Graves' disease (GD) is the commonest cause of hyperthyroidism, accounted for 70-80% in iodine sufficient countries and up to 50% in iodine deficient countries. It is typically presented in patients between 40-60 years old, and predominantly affects women, with female to male ratio was estimated around 8:1(1). The combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors (2, 3) influences the development of GD. Using structural equation model to test the effect of genetic and environmental components in the development of GD amongst twin subjects, Brix et al. were able to estimate the 80% attributability of genetic factors and 20% of individual-specific environmental factors (3). Environmental factors that are postulated to affect the development of GD are iodine, medications, infections, smoking, as well as stress (2).\n The immunopathogenesis of GD is established. Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) produced by B-cell clones, stimulates the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) in a manner that resembles TSH and further induce thyrocytes proliferation, thyroid growth, and secretion of thyroid hormones (4,5). GD is characterized by hyperthyroidism, diffuse hyperfunctioning goiter and may be accompanied by extra-thyroid manifestation such as orbito-pathy, myxedema and acropachy. \n Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of GD with substantial impact on morbidity and quality of life (6,7). A study in Minnesota previously estimated GO to contribute to 16/100,000 per year for women and 2.9/100,000 per year for men (8). Several reports have been published to confirm the expression of TSHR mRNA and protein in orbital tissues in healthy individuals and those with GO (7, 9). Infiltration of the orbital tissue by activated lymphocytes results in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines that leads to the development of histological and clinical characteristics of GO. GO may develop prior or after the onset of hyperthyroidism, with only 20-30 % GO patients require aggressive treatments (7).\n  Case Report",

    "clinical_text": "A 59-year-old Japanese man presented with a year history of nasal obstruction and a 2-month history of slight headache. Nasal examination showed swelling and crust formation of the bilateral inferior turbinate. CT scan revealed swelling of the mucosa in the bilateral ethmoid sinuses and soft-tissue filling in the right sphenoid sinus (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). We initially diagnosed chronic rhinosinusitis and performed endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) under general anesthesia. We opened the bilateral ethmoid and the sphenoid sinuses. During ESS, easy bleeding and granulomatous mucosa in the bilateral ethmoid sinuses was seen and resected (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Histopathological examination of the mucosa revealed necrotizing vasculitis with multinucleated giant cells (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). We then examined the patient systemically. Brain MRI and chest CT scan showed no abnormal finding. Urinalysis revealed neither hematuria nor proteinuria. Bilateral ear drums were normal. No hearing or visual loss was identified. Negative results for serum proteinase 3- (PR3-) and myeloperoxidase- (MPO-) anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) were obtained from fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA). We diagnosed the limited form of GPA. Shortly after making this diagnosis, the headache resolved and nasal obstruction disappeared. The patient declined immunosuppressive treatment for fear of worsening of his diabetes mellitus. We started careful follow-up every 3 months.\nEighteen months after the diagnosis of GPA, the patient presented with diplopia and sudden onset of severe right-sided headache. Nasal endoscopic examination revealed only slight edematous mucosa in the bilateral nasal cavity and the ethmoid sinus. The opening of the right sphenoid sinus was closed by the granulation covered with mucosa, and we could not look into the inside of the sinus. CT scan revealed a lesion of the right sphenoid sinus eroding the bone of the clivus and thickening of the dura mater (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain showed thickening of the dura mater around the right cavernous sinus and clivus (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and cerebral angiography revealed narrowing at the C5 portion of the ICA (Figures 5(a)-5(d)). Results for serum PR3- and MPO-ANCA were negative. We diagnosed HCP and right abducens nerve palsy, and stenosis of the intracranial ICA due to GPA extension. The patient did not show ischemic attack. Intravenous methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy was administered at 1g/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone (PSL) at 30 mg/day and cyclophosphamide (CY) at 50 mg/day. The PSL dose was gradually tapered. The headache disappeared immediately. One year after the initiation of the treatment, the patient showed slight saddle nose deformity but did not complain of nasal pain and obstruction. Brain MRI and MRA showed a reduction in the thickness of the dura mater and improved blood flow in the ICA (Figures 5(e)-5(g)). Although the patient still has right abducens nerve palsy, he has not complained of headache for 2 years under a medication with oral PSL at 7 mg/day and azathioprine at 25 mg/day.",

She also complained of dry cough while eating and difficulty swallowing solid foods. Unexplained weight loss, fever, diaphoresis, fatigue, anorexia, dyspnea and neck pain were denied.\nPertinent personal medical history included obstructive sleep apnea with nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure use, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux for the past 3 years. She had no prior history of neck surgery or external radiation. Family history included various types of cancer - pancreatic cancer in her father, lung cancer in her uncle, breast cancer in her mother and sister, and papillary thyroid cancer in her maternal aunt.\nA firm mass moving with deglutition was palpated over the right anterior neck on physical exam. There was no tracheal deviation. Voice was clear with full projection, and vocal cords were mobile with normal appearance on flexible laryngoscopy. An elevated TSH (7.36 mIU/L), detectable thyroid peroxidase antibodies (41 IU/mL), and normal free T3 (2.4 pmol/L) and free T4 (1.04 ng/dL) levels were consistent with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.\nThyroid ultrasound demonstrated a 5.8 x 2.8 x 3.6 cm right lobe containing two solid hypoechoic, not taller-than-wide thyroid nodules with smooth margins and no echogenic foci, measuring 4.2 cm and 1.8 cm, respectively. Both nodules increased in size during 18-month interval, 1 cm in two dimensions. The left lobe measured 4.3 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm and had no nodules. FNAC was performed at an outside facility (2017), according to the recommendations of the American College of Radiologists for a TIRADS 3 nodule with a growth > 2 mm in two dimensions and over 20% increase in volume. Lymphocytic thyroiditis and absence of malignant cells was reported. A second FNAC prompted by nodule growth revealed similar results 18 months later. Cytology slides review at our institution was concordant.\nCervical and thoracic CT scans were not ordered as the goiter had no substernal extension and there was low suspicion for malignancy on FNAC. Recent esophago-gastroscopy documented no masses or mucosal changes concerning for malignancy.\nThe patient elected to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy to relieve her compressive symptoms, after discussing options, including a repeat biopsy. The extent of surgery was planned considering the normal appearance of the left thyroid lobe and absence of nodules on ultrasound, and to minimize her risk for potential surgical complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism. Surgery was uneventful, she recovered well. Her voice was at baseline and she had no wound complications. Surgical pathology unexpectedly revealed a mixed TL. Overall features were consistent with germinal center subtype DLBCL, rising from a low-grade FL with overexpression of BCL2 and C-MYC. The non-neoplastic areas of thyroid parenchyma were compatible with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.\nGross examination (Fig. 1) revealed a 53 g thyroid lobe measuring 6.3 x 5.2 x 4.0 cm, containing a 5.8 cm tumor extending to the inked capsule. Microscopic evaluation (Fig. 2) showed diffuse infiltrates of large pleomorphic cells, and areas with nodular infiltrate of small sized cells with irregular nuclei. The DLBCL infiltrate was estimated at 70% of the tumor while the small cell infiltrate arranged in follicles, composed approximately 30%. The lymphoma did not show extension beyond the boundaries of the thyroid lobe. Immunohistochemistry (IHC, Fig. 3), revealed CD20 + B cells which co-expressed CD10, BCL6 and BCL2, but not cyclin 1. Ki-67 index was 20% in the FL and 90% in the DLBCL component. C-MYC immunostaining was approximately 40% in the DLBCL area. C-MYC gene rearrangement was not identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH).\nThe patient was referred to Oncology for staging and treatment. Bone marrow biopsy showed no tumor involvement. Initial fluodeoxyglucose-18 positron emission tomography (FDG-18 PET) showed an isolated hypermetabolic area in the ipsilateral lower chest and no avid lesions in the abdomen or pelvis, concordant with her cross-sectional imaging. Systemic chemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) was initiated which she tolerated well, followed by involved-field radiotherapy.",

Visual acuity was not measurable because the patient was too young. The anterior segment of the right eye was normal by slit-lamp examinations, but a totally detached retina was observed. Because the detached retina was close to the lens, the peripheral retina could not be observed (<PMC4943774_cop-0007-0223-g01_undivided_1_1.webp>). There were no abnormal findings in the left eye. B-mode ultrasonography showed a diffuse, high echo area in the vitreous cavity with no apparent sign of calcification (fig. 2). The CT image that had been taken at a previous hospital 1 month earlier showed no evidence of calcification in the right eye (fig. 2). The MRI evaluations taken at 1 of the 2 previous hospitals showed high-intensity signals in the T1-weighted images and low-intensity signals in the T2-weighted images in the vitreous body of the right eye.

First, external subretinal fluid (SRF) drainage was performed, and SRF was submitted for a rapid pathological examination, so this was a diagnostic procedure. The examination showed many histiocytes and a small number of epithelial cells but no signs of malignancy. Second, lens-sparing vitrectomy was performed, and the retina was reattached under perfluoro-n-octane.

Endophotocoagulation was performed on the microaneurysms and the presumably avascular retina near the abnormal vessels. At the end of vitrectomy, 0.5 mg of bevacizumab was injected intravitreally.\nPostoperatively, the posterior retina was reattached; however, the dilated retinal vessels and peripheral subretinal exudates had not improved even after 3 months.\nA reoperation with similar techniques to the first surgery was performed (fig. 5).\nThree months after the reoperation, a reduction in SRF and exudates was observed.

    "clinical_text": "A healthy 18-year-old female with a non-contributory medical history was referred to the Department of Endodontics with a chief complaint of recurrent dental abscess and pain on the left side of her face. At the time of first clinical examination, no swelling was noticed. Intraoral examination revealed bilateral peg-shaped lateral incisors (Fig. 1). \nTooth #10 did not respond to sensibility test and was tender on percussion and palpation. The probing depth of all anterior teeth was within the normal range. On the diagnostic periapical radiograph, a periapical lesion was noticed, which was associated with tooth #10 extending apically to the ipsilateral impacted canine (Fig. 2).\nThe root canal configuration of tooth #10 corresponded to the Oehlers type II DI. The CBCT evaluation revealed no communication between the invagination and periodontium. The associated periapical lesion extended to the crown of the impacted canine and had not perforated the buccal or palatal cortical plates (Fig. 3).\nAccording to the clinical and radiographic examinations, the diagnosis for tooth #10 was pulpal necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis. After obtaining informed consent, root canal treatment was initiated. \nIn the first session, local infiltration anesthesia was administered by injection of one cartridge of 3% mepivacaine (Oxicaine; Exsir, Iran). A modified access cavity was prepared through the incisal tip of the tooth. Any lateral lumen within the invaginated area was searched under x4 magnification using a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). \nThe invaginated defect was entered by a high-speed diamond bur (Jota, Switzerland) to a depth of 8 mm. Upon exploration with a #12 C-pilot file (VDW, Munchen, Germany) a soft necrotic soft tissue was detected at the apical end of the cavity which dropped into a root canal-like space. The position of the file was confirmed using an electronic apex locator (Root ZX; J Morita, Japan) and periapical radiography. The access opening and root canal negotiation were performed under a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germay). Cleaning and shaping of the root canal system was performed with ProTaper system using Wizard navigator rotary file (Medin, Czech Republic). \nA total of 2mL of 5.25% NaOCl was used after each instrument as the root canal irrigant, and the solution was agitated using PD1 ultrasonic tip mounted on NSK ultrasonic device (Varios 970; NSK, Japan) with the power set to level 6 for 20s. \nBecause of persistent purulent intracanal discharge, calcium hydroxide was introduced into the canal as an inter-appointment medicament using 2% chlorhexidine (Shahr Darou, Iran) as the vehicle. In order to avoid chemical interaction between the irrigants, the canal was rinsed with saline solution thoroughly to remove the remnants of NaOCl. Finally, reinforced zinc oxide eugenol (Zoliran, Golchadent, Iran) was placed in the access cavity as a temporary restoration. Two weeks later, the patient was recalled; her tenderness to palpation and percussion had diminished but was not completely resolved. However, intracanal purulent discharge was persistent. \nTherefore, double antibiotic paste (DAP) consisting of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole (Rouzdarou, Iran) was prepared by mixing 250 mg of each antibiotic powder with saline to obtain a clinically applicable consistency, and the resultant mixture was used as the intracanal medicament. On the third session, which was scheduled 2 weeks later, the intracanal drainage was substantially controlled. Due to external resorption of the apical part of the root, RetroMTA (BioMTA, Deajon, Seoul, Korea) was placed as an apical plug to provide an adequate seal in the apical portion of the root canal up to the point of invagination defect and temporarily sealed (Fig. 4). \nOn the next session, the ultimate setting of the RetroMTA was confirmed, and the remaining coronal space of the root canal was reserved for post placement. The access cavity was sealed for a relatively longer period of time using 3mm of light curable glass ionomer (Fuji II LC, GC, Tokyo, Japan) and 1mm of composite resin (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) to evaluate the treatment result. After 3 months, radiographic examination revealed substantial bone formation in the periapical lesion, and clinical examination of the patient revealed no signs or symptoms. In order to maintain the coronal seal during the orthodontic treatment, the MTA apical plug was backfilled using gutta-percha (Meta (Dentsply, Tulsa, OK, USA) with warm vertical compaction technique (Fig. 5). Biomed, Seoul, Korea) and AH26 sealer.\nThe access cavity was restored with composite resin. Upon periapical radio-graphic evaluation after 6 months, complete bone formation was observed in the periradicular area (Fig. 6a). At the one-year follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and the periapical radiograph showed bone healing and no evidence of recurrence of the periapical lesion (Fig. 6b).",

The patient used to come for follow-ups every month on an outpatient basis. He used to receive the depot injection from a psychiatric nurse near his place. On follow-up after 1 month, the patient complained of dull pain over the injection site. On local physical examination, mild swelling was noticed and this was managed by a brief course of analgesics: diclofenac 50 mg two times per day for 5 days. On the second follow-up, the pain increased in severity with high-level discomfort in movement. The injection site was examined by the resident. A 4-cm x 4-cm deep-seated necrotic ulceration (Figure 1), along with two other lumps over the previous injection sites, was noticed. In view of the above complication, a further dose of fluphenazine was stopped and the patient was immediately referred to general surgery consultation for evaluation and management. Wound debridement along with wide excision of margins was done by the surgeon and a course of prophylactic antibiotics (cephazolin 2 g intravenous for 5 days) was given.

Further investigation was advised which included panoramic radiograph and computed tomography (CT) angiography. In panoramic radiograph, there was evidence of multiple calcifications overlapping the areas of left maxillary tuberosity and mandibular ramus region suggestive of phleboliths [<PMC11057590_NJMS-15-160-g003_undivided_1_1.webp>]. IN CT angiography, there was a evidence of approximately 5 x 25 x 60 mm (AP x TR x SI) sized well-defined heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue density lesion seen in the superficial and intramuscular planes along the left masseter muscle. Laterally, the lesion was reaching up to the skin. Medially, the lesion was overlying the left ramus of mandible. Postero-laterally, the lesion is causing lateral displacement of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland.

Her symptoms had been recalcitrant to several courses of therapy for a presumptive diagnosis of candidal vaginitis. She had been treated initially with fluconazole, then sequentially with topical clotrimazole, ticoconazole ointment, and intravaginal boric acid gel. Her medical history was notable for mild gastritis (treated with omeprazole) and irregular uterine bleeding, controlled with hormone replacement therapy (a transdermal estrogen/progesterone combination). The patient was in a monogamous relationship with her husband but reported abstinence for several months because of the severity of her vaginal symptoms.\nOn physical examination, vaginal erythema with a white liquid vaginal discharge was observed. Although a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation was not obtained at baseline, the discharge grew P. lilacinus in pure culture.\nThe patient was treated empirically with itraconazole, 200 mg orally twice a day for 3 weeks. At the end of therapy, she reported complete resolution of her vaginal discharge and a significant decrease in her vaginal pruritus. A repeat vaginal culture was not obtained at her first follow-up appointment after completion of itraconazole therapy because the vaginal vault contained a large amount of blood. At an appointment 6 months later, she remained free of vaginal discharge; a vaginal fungal culture and KOH preparation performed at that time were negative.\nThe results of laboratory studies, including serum protein electrophoresis (with immunoglobulin [Ig] G, IgA, IgM) C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a complete blood count, CD4 cell count, and CD8 cell count were all within normal limits. Results of a test for antibodies to HIV were negative. An anergy panel (with Candida and Trichophytin used as controls) was reactive. A purified protein derivative was not placed because the patient had a history of a positive test result.\nThe patient's isolate was forwarded to the Fungus Testing Laboratory, Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, for confirmation of the identity and antifungal susceptibility testing, and accessioned into the stock collection as UTHSC 01-872. The isolate was initially subcultured onto potato flakes agar (PFA, prepared in house), which was prepared in-house, at 25 C, 30 C, 35 C, and 40 C (ambient air with alternating daylight and darkness). The isolate was subsequently plated onto carnation leaf agar (CLA [prepared in-house]) and malt agar (Remel, Lenexa, KS) at 25 C. Temperature studies were repeated after initial observations.\nThe case isolate was evaluated for susceptibility to antifungal agents by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards broth macrodilution method M38-P. Briefly, the case isolate and the P. variotii control organism, UTHSC 90-450, were grown on PFA for 7 to 10 days at 25 C to induce conidial formation. The mature PFA isolate and control slants were overlaid with sterile distilled water, and suspensions were made by gently scraping the colonies with the tip of a Pasteur pipette. Heavy hyphal fragments were allowed to settle, and the upper, homogeneous conidial suspensions were removed. Conidia were counted with a hemacytometer, and the inoculum was standardized to 1.0 x 105 CFU/mL. Conidial suspensions were further diluted 1:10 in medium for a final inoculum concentration of 1.0 x 104 CFU/mL. Final drug concentrations were 0.03-16 mug/mL for amphotericin B (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), ketoconazole (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Titusville, NJ) and clotrimazole (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ), 0.125-64 mug/mL for 5-flucytosine (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ), fluconazole, voriconazole (Pfizer, Inc, New York, NY), and terconazole (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Raritan, NJ), and 0.015-8 mug/mL for itraconazole (Janssen Pharmaceutica) and posaconazole (Schering-Plough).",

    "clinical_text": "The incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in the elderly population is increasing due to the aging of the general population. Statistics from U.S. National Cancer Institute demonstrated that the incidence of AML is 23/100,000 in the age range of 80-84 years, while 21.2/100,000 over the age of 85, which is ~20 times greater than the incidence in younger patients. The biological characteristics, clinical manifestations and treatment response of AML in elderly individuals differs from that in young patients. The major characteristics of AML in elderly patients include: i) high incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities; ii) high incidence of therapy-related leukemia; iii) association with a prior hematological disease; iv) often accompanied by multidrug resistance gene expression; v) high incidence of comorbidity and poor tolerance to chemotherapy. All of these features contribute to low remission and short survival times. There are no standard treatment regimens for AML in elderly patients. Intensive chemotherapy is not suitable for the treatment of AML in patients over 80 years old. Common regimens such as low-dose cytarabine chemotherapy and the best supportive care alone do not prolong survival times significantly in elderly patients. The mean survival time of patients with AML over 80 years old is ~3 months. Therefore, the treatment regimens for elderly patients with AML has evolved from chemotherapy only to targeted therapies. The new drugs under investigation include: humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, proteasome inhibitors, anti-angiogenic drugs, FLT3 inhibitors and anti-apoptotic inhibitors.

    "clinical_text": "A 39-year-old Chinese male was diagnosed with FL (grade 3b, stage III, group A, FLIPI was 3, high risk and FLIPI-2 was 2, intermediate risk) in January 2020. Immunohistochemical results for lymphoma cells of left cervical lymph nodes were as follows: BCL6 (+), MUM1 (+), Ki-67 (80%+), CD20 (+), Pax5 (+), BCL2 (+), CD10 (+), CyclinD1 (-), and sparsely positive for CD3, CD5, CD15, CD30, CD68, and C-MYC. EBER by in situ hybridization test was negative in the lymphoma cells. Multiple lymphadenopathies on both sides of the mediastinum with high uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were revealed by positron emission tomography (PET-CT). The patient obtained CMR by PET-CT evaluation after 3 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 0, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 day 1, pirarubicin 50 mg/m2 day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 day 1, and prednisone 100 mg day 1-5). After receiving additional 3 cycles of R-CHOP and 1 cycle of maintenance R therapy, PET-CT indicated an enlarged lymph node with high uptake in the right pelvic cavity (SUVmax was 7, Deauville was 5), and the original disease relapsed early. As the patient had no symptoms at the time, he refused further biopsy and treatment.\nIn March 2021, the patient complained of pain in the back and lower extremities, and further core needle aspiration biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node revealed grade 2 FL. The patient received 1 cycle of BR (rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 0 and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 day 1,2). Although pain relief and thrombosis occurred in his right lower limb, the disease progressed with further enlargement of the soft tissue mass in the bilateral inguinal and right paravascular iliac arteries. Subsequently, 2 cycles of GB ( ortuzumab 1000 mg day 1, 8, 15 for the first cycle and day 1 for the second cycle, bendamustine 90 mg/m2 day 1, 2 for each cycle) were administered. Unfortunately, the disease showed no response to treatment with salvage immunochemotherapy. Then, PET-CT scans showed a bulky mass (a maximum diameter of 84 mm) from the right psoas major muscle to the right pelvic wall with increased FDG uptake (SUVmax was 42.1) and a soft tissue mass in the right groin with increased FDG uptake (SUVmax was 21.2) ( Figure 1A ). The third pathological investigation of the right paravascular iliac lesion indicated that the lymphoma had transformed into DLBCL (GCB subtype) that was negative for CD20 and positive for Bcl-6 (90%+), MUM1 (90%+), Ki-67 (80%+), Bcl-2 (90%+), c-myc (60%+), CD10 (+), and CD19(+) ( Figure 1B ). A negative rearrangement of MYC and a positive rearrangement of BCL2 were demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the paraffin-embedded lymphoma tissues was performed using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform technology. The results showed that TP53 mutations were always present in 3 pathological specimens from different sites ( Table 1 ). Moreover, there were more than 10 kinds of gene mutations, including TP53, KMT2D, MS4A1, CD83, DUSP2, EZH2, FOXO1, HIST1H1C, HIST1H1E, NFKBIA, SGK1, SOCS1, STAT3, and TBL1XR1.\nThe patient received CD19 CAR T-cell infusion following ASCT therapy. Auto hematopoietic stem cells were collected after 1 cycle of DHAP (dexamethasone 40 mg day 1-4, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1, cytarabine 2 g/m2 q12h day 2) with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (560 mg/day) administered continuously as salvage chemotherapy. One month later, autolymphocyte apheresis was performed to manufacture CAR T cells. During the production of CD19 CAR T cells, 1 cycle of ICE (ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 day 2, carboplatin 737 mg day 2, etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1-3) was administered as a bridging regimen. PET-CT evaluation before ASCT and CAR T-cell infusion indicated PD with a novel intraperitoneal tumor mass near the posterior abdominal wall and other remaining masses ( <PMC10739420_fimmu-14-1307242-g002_A_1_3.webp> ). The patient underwent BEAM conditioning (carmustine 300 mg/m2 day -7, etoposide 200 mg/m2 day -6~-3, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 q12h day -6~-3, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 day -2) and ASCT following CD19 CAR T-cell infusion. On May 28, 2022 (day 01), and May 29, 2022 (day 02), a total of 3.8 x 106/kg CD34+ stem cells were infused. The patient received an infusion of CD19 CAR T cells (relmacabtagene autoleucel, relma-cel, JWCAR029, 2.7 ml containing 108 CAR T cells) on June 1, 2022 (day 3). Platelets were 35x109/L, implanted on June 18, 2022 (day 20); neutrophils were 1.52x109/L implanted on June 19, 2022 (day 21); lymphocytes were 1.6x109/L on July 7, 2022 (day 39). CD4 was 374/ul, IgG 5.57g/L, IgA 0.25g/L, IgM 0.12g/L on July 7, 2022 (day 39).\nOn the 4th day after ASCT (the 1st day after CAR T-cell infusion), the patient's oral mucosa showed pseudomembranes and ulcers, and he had diarrhea 3-5 times a day but was able to eat and swallow liquid diet. Therefore, a diagnosis of mucositis grade 2 was made, which lasted for 6 days and gradually recovered. Additionally, on the 2nd day after CAR T-cell infusion, the patient developed a fever with a temperature of approximately 38.5 C and was not effectively treated with nonsteroidal antipyretic analgesic drugs and antibiotics. Repeated bacterial blood cultures were negative. On the 4th day after CAR T-cell infusion, the patient's blood pressure was 88/49 mmHg (the IL-6 level was 659.7 pg/ml) and was not effectively treated with rapid fluid replenishment. The patient was diagnosed with CRS grade 2 and treated with one dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab. His blood pressure gradually returned to normal within a few hours, and his temperature gradually returned to normal within 2 days. There was no ICANS after CAR T-cell infusion.\nSurprisingly, PET-CT examination demonstrated CMR in the +1 month after CD19 CAR T-cell infusion following ASCT ( <PMC10739420_fimmu-14-1307242-g002_B_2_3.webp> ). At the last follow-up, the patient received ibrutinib as maintenance therapy and remained in CMR ( <PMC10739420_fimmu-14-1307242-g002_C_3_3.webp> ). Importantly, the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) results indicated that the mutations of TP53, KMT2D, MS4A1, SOCS1 and HIST1H1C were persistently negative after CD19 CAR T-cell infusion following ASCT ( Table 2 ).

On initial presentation, the uncorrected visual acuity was 6/15 bilaterally with normal intraocular pressures and pupillary examination. On motility assessment, there was a -1 abduction deficit of the affected eye (OD) with no significant proptosis noted using an exophthalmometer. However, the OD revealed fullness of the upper eyelid with approximately 3-mm blepharoptosis without eyelid erythema or tenderness (shown in <PMC10978040_cop-2024-0015-0001-536382_F01_undivided_1_1.webp>). On eyelid eversion, there was a large 30-mm x 10-mm x 4-mm multilobulated, vascularised, and papillomatous lesion arising within the superior conjunctival fornix and some parts of the bulbar conjunctiva (shown in <PMC10978040_cop-2024-0015-0001-536382_F01_undivided_1_1.webp>, 2). The remainder of the anterior and posterior segment examination was unremarkable. The left eye (OS) was also examined to be normal. The differential diagnoses based on the clinical findings included pyogenic granuloma, papilloma, lymphoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.\nAn urgent subtotal excision of the lesion was performed in the theatre, and histopathological assessment was conducted. This demonstrated an infiltrate of mitotically active spindled cells positive for desmin, myoD1, and myogenin, therefore highly suggestive of rhabdomyosarcoma (shown in <PMC10978040_cop-2024-0015-0001-536382_F03_left_1_3.webp><PMC10978040_cop-2024-0015-0001-536382_F03_middle_2_3.webp><PMC10978040_cop-2024-0015-0001-536382_F03_right_3_3.webp>). The fluorescent in situ hybridisation assay demonstrated no rearrangement of the FOX01 gene consistent with the embryonal variant of rhabdomyosarcoma.\nFollowing the diagnosis, a systemic staging process was conducted including CT chest, MRI brain, orbits, and spine in addition to a PET scan. This revealed stage 1, group 2 disease with no evidence of metastatic disease. The patient was treated with vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide, as per protocol ARST0331. Six months post treatment, the patient remains tumour-free with no ocular complications.",

His demographic data included non-Hispanic/Caucasian ethnicity/race, BMI of 22, not vaccinated against COVID-19, and no prior medications. On admission, his temperature was 30.0 C, but within 24 h it had risen to 39.0 C. His admission blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg, and he was emergently intubated for airway protection secondary to profound encephalopathy. His initial laboratory findings included pH < 6.78 (7.35-7.45), bicarbonate <5 mEq/L (22-29 mmol/L), creatinine 3.69 mg/dL, blood glucose 1,959 mg/dL (70-199 mg/dL), and lactate 4.8 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L). His inflammatory markers were elevated with a CRP of 232 mg/L, ferritin of 15,000 mug/L, and a procalcitonin of 22 mug/L (<0.26 mug/L). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse cerebral edema without herniation or hemorrhage, and edematous pancreatitis. A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive with a cycle threshold of 36.1, and a nucleocapsid IgG was also positive. The differential diagnosis for his syndrome considered by treating clinicians included sepsis, COVID-19, diabetic ketoacidosis, overdose, toxin exposure, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.\nThe patient underwent volume and metabolic resuscitation to treat severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute pancreatitis, but nonetheless developed progressive shock requiring rapid escalation of vasopressor support. On hospital day 1, he developed emesis, a petechial rash, and a new junctional cardiac rhythm. ECG revealed diffuse ST-segment elevation. His troponin I peaked at 50 mug/L. A TTE showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis. On hospital day 2, dobutamine was started, a percutaneous LVAD was placed, and continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens. On hospital day 3, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated.\nWhile on admission the patient was hypothermic, he met clinical and laboratory criteria for MIS-A on hospital day 1 based on the presence of fever, severe cardiac illness, encephalopathy, shock, elevated CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin, and positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG. In addition to antibiotics, fluids, electrolytes and insulin, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone 1 gram IV for 3 days, IVIG 2 g/kg over 2 days, and anakinra 100 mg twice daily for 2 days, then daily for 3 days, and clinically improved. COVID-19 was treated with Remdesivir 100 mg IV daily for 4 days. VA-ECMO and the LVAD was removed on day 8, he was extubated on day 12, and vasopressor and inotropic support was discontinued on day 13. He required ongoing renal replacement therapy for volume removal and was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on hospital day 23 on a prednisone taper and intermittent hemodialysis. His hemoglobin A1c was greater than 14% and testing for islet cell autoantibodies revealed positive GAD-65, Zinc transporter 8, and islet cell antigen152 antibodies, consistent with a new diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes.",

Physical examination revealed no signs of hyperaemia, tenderness, drainage from the exit site, or subcutaneous tunnel of the catheter. Auscultation of her chest and abdominal examination were normal. No obvious causes of non-catheter-related infection were observed. A complete blood count at the time of admission revealed a slightly increased absolute neutrophil count (8.5 x 109 cells/L) with a dramatic increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Her haemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL and her C-reactive protein was 6.6 mg/L. Echocardiography, chest computed tomography, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed; however, no source of infection was revealed. Therefore, empirical treatment with oral cefuroxime axetil (500 mg/day) was initiated for presumed CRBSI.\nOn the patient's third day of hospitalisation, blood cultures from the catheter lumen and peripheral vein revealed Acinetobacter baumannii, with sensitivity to ceftazidime, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate, meropenem, imipenem, and sulfamethoxazole. However, she developed a positive reaction in the skin test for ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam. Therefore, we chose 500 mg of intravenous levofloxacin (quinolone) to be administered every other day, which was tailored to the residual renal function. Antibiotic lock therapy was used to salvage the catheter. The levofloxacin (2 mg/mL) and heparin (1,000 U/mL) mixture produced turbidity. Therefore, we prescribed an antimicrobial lock of levofloxacin (2 mg/mL) and urokinase (5,000 U/mL) once daily.\nThe patient's symptoms resolved after the initiation of appropriate antibiotics. Subsequent blood cultures obtained 3 days after treatment initiation was negative; thus, the catheter was salvaged. The effects of treatment on the routine laboratory parameters are shown in Table 1. Intravenous antibiotic treatment and antibiotic lock therapy were administered for 14 days, without any allergic reactions. The patient did not develop a recurrence of infection over the next 9 months, after which she underwent successful kidney transplantation (<PMC10105553_j_med-2023-0699-fig001_undivided_1_1.webp>). Additionally, we verified the physical compatibility of levofloxacin and urokinase by visual inspection, turbidimetric measurements, and particle count.",

    "clinical_text": "A 9-year-old boy with intermittent fever for 2 months was transferred to our hospital on November 3, 2021. He was born with alpha thalassemia (-SEA/alphaalpha), and from his birth to 2018, he had received five red blood cell transfusions. He has been Bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated at birth under the national vaccination program. He has no recent travel history, and his parents reported no family hereditary diseases, besides thalassemia, no TB history nor TB exposure.\nThe patient started to develop intermittent fever in August 2021, with the highest body temperature of 38.0 C and night sweats. There were no respiratory symptoms or weight loss. He was admitted to a local children hospital shortly after his fever had persisted for 5 days. His routine blood test on admission showed white blood cell (WBC) 2.6 x 109/L, neutrophils (Neu) 1.15 x 109/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 74 g/L, and platelets (PLT) 211 x 109/L. Ultrasound scan revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and an enlarged spleen.\nIn 3 days, his hemoglobin level dropped to 64 g/L, and he was given 2U red blood cell infusion. Repeated blood test on the following day showed decreased level of WBC to 1.5 x 109/L and Neu of 0.51 x 109/L with an elevated Hb level of 90 g/L and an unremarkable change of PLT 201 x 109/L. Viral markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EB DNA) was negative. In addition, subsequent blood interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and skin purified protein derivative (PPD) tests were positive. Lung computed tomography (CT) showed calcification of the right hilum and mediastinal lymph nodes. In the absence of lung infiltration and tuberculous foci, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) was suspected. A bone marrow aspiration smear performed the following day showed active bone marrow hyperplasia, significantly decreased neutrophil level, and generally normal morphology. The patient had persistent daily fever between 37.4 C and 38.8 C accompanied with dry cough, fatigue, and loss of appetite. He was empirically administered with amoxicillin 0.25 g three times a day for 3 days and antifebrile for a week. But his fever remained unsolved during the treatment, fluctuating in the same range as before. Pathological findings from his cervical lymph node biopsy showed no caseous necrosis and no acid-fast mycobacteria. The persistent low WBC in peripheral blood had raised concern. To look into possible causes of the persistent fever, a second bone marrow puncture was performed. Bone marrow smear was positive for acid-fast staining (Figure 1). Disseminated TB infection was suspected. But further sputum and cerebrospinal fluid smear were negative for both acid-fast staining and TB-DNA (CapitalBio Technology, China). Thus, pulmonary TB and tuberculous meningitis were ruled out. The bone marrow was presumed as the tuberculous origin. Anti-TB regimen composing isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was initiated from the diagnosis. His temperature resumed to normal range 4 days later. His appetite also improved.\nBut a week later, he had fever again with the highest measure of 40.0 C. Serum ferritin was observed to have elevated to 3,603.35 ng/ml (reference: < 300 ng/ml). Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg q12 h was administered as anti-inflammatory therapy, but his fever did not go away. A repeated bone marrow aspiration was performed the following day to investigate the causes for the unresolved fever, elevated serum ferritin, and decreased WBC. Bone marrow biopsy showed active hyperplasia with occasional hemophagocytic histiocytes, mainly phagocytizing white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (Figure 2). Bone marrow for real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for TB was positive; moreover, gene sequencing revealed the promotor region of InhA gene mutation (-15C > T), which caused resistance to isoniazid. Bone marrow for TB culture was performed but had finally turned out negative. Serum ferritin was precisely monitored and was found to further elevated to 9612.81 ng/ml in 5 days. HPS was confirmed, and 10 mg/kg of methylprednisolone was prescribed daily. In 2 days, the patient's fever resolved. Serum ferritin dropped to 5,755.54 ng/ml and WBC in peripheral blood was restored to a normal level. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed no variants of exon. This test result rule out the known primary genetic causes of HLH. Diagnosis was confirmed as having (1) bone marrow TB with isoniazid resistance; (2) secondary HPS.\nBefore administration of isoniazid-resistant TB regimen modification, the patient developed nausea, loss of appetite without fever 18 days after initial anti-TB regimen. Systematic examination revealed yellow skin and sclera with hepatosplenomegaly. Liver function test showed total bilirubin (TBIL) of 111.1 mumol/L, directed bilirubin (DBIL) 67.3 mumol/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 520.5 U/L, and aspartate transaminase (AST) 321.5 U/L, which were consistent with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). He was transferred to our hospital for specialized tuberculosis management where his regimen was reviewed and modified to the following: linezolid 300 mg/day, ethambutol 0.5 g/day, and levofloxacin 0.25 g/day based on his body weight of 25 kg. Methylprednisolone was reduced to 2 mg/kg/q8h. As serum ferritin was gradually decreasing and his body temperature and WBC were normal, methylprednisolone was lowered to 0.4 mg/kg/q12h 12 days later.\nAfter 15 days of the above therapy, a follow-up evaluation of bone marrow aspirate for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and qPCR assay showed no detection of M. tuberculosis. Subsequent laboratory investigations confirmed normal liver function and a lowered serum ferritin level of 1,150.0 ng/ml. A 0.3-g rifapentine was added twice a week to his anti-TB regimen. He was discharged with the prescribed methylprednisolone at a tapering dose of 4 mg every 10 days (Figure 3) until the next follow-up consultation. He is being followed up in our outpatient unit for the next 2 years for this rare medical condition. The child has no more fever, but his hepatosplenomegaly persisted. He has returned to school and is leading a normal life. As of press time, the patient's anti-TB treatment is still ongoing.",

She had recently moved interstate, with no patient data available in our hospital system. The patient also reported anorexia and weight loss of approximately 3 kg in the past 6 months. On examination, she was afebrile, pulse rate was 90 beats min-1, respiratory rate was mildly increased at 22 breaths min-1 and blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mmHg. On auscultation of the chest, fine rales over the right lung base were noted. Laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count at 7300 cells l-1 (3.5-11 x 109 cells l-1), C-reactive protein 14 mg l-1 (< 5 mg l-1) and haemoglobin 100 g l-1 (110-165 g l-1). Her initial chest X-ray showed an opacity in the right lower lobe (RLL) contiguous with the right hemidiaphragm (Figure 1). A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a 2.8 cm solid enhancing nodule in the posterobasal segment of the RLL with a density measuring 35 HU, with a 7 mm central focus of dense calcification (Figure 2); also noted were hyperdense endobronchial material in the RLL, which was thought to represent fresh blood. A suspicion of lung cancer was raised, especially in view of heavy smoking history and reported weight loss. Positron emission tomography revealed increased 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5] within the RLL nodule; the report described the finding as concerning for malignancy, with the differential diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumour (Figure 3). A subsequent bronchoscopy was complicated owing to active bleeding from the RLL bronchus. The transbronchial biopsy showed no malignant cells, acid-fast bacilli or fungi.\nUpon targeted questioning, the patient disclosed having had a complicated cholecystectomy 3 years ago, performed at another hospital, with attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted into an open laparotomy owing to gallbladder rupture with intraperitoneal spillage of gallstones; this was complicated by the formation of post-operative subphrenic abscess, which was surgically drained. The relevant externally performed images have been retrieved, including a CT scan of the abdomen (Figure 4). The patient further admitted to occasional episodes of minor haemoptysis of about two spoonfuls over the past 2 years, associated with right-sided mild chest pain, which she did not seek medical attention for.\nAs the RLL mass was the presumed cause for the repeated episodes of haemoptysis, a thoracotomy was recommended and the patient underwent a RLL wedge resection. A firm rhomboid-shaped calculus measuring 11 x 7 x 8 mm (Figure 5) that dislodged from the specimen was confirmed to be a gallstone. Pathological examination additionally found abundant bile pigment (25%) surrounded by microorganisms, extensive interstitial fibrosis and hyalinization. Further biochemical analysis of the calculus revealed the presence of 85% cholesterol. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital in a satisfactory condition 1 week after the surgery.",

He also reported experiencing a dry cough, easy fatigue, shortness of breath, and painful swallowing, with no history of nausea or vomiting. The patient had been evaluated two weeks earlier in the ED due to the same symptoms; at the time, he was diagnosed with salmonellosis and treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid for eight days, with temporary improvement of his symptoms. However, his condition worsened following the completion of antibiotics, and he needed to be readmitted to the hospital. He had returned from Colombia three weeks prior to the episode, and his medical history was remarkable for treated pulmonary tuberculosis (in 2019) and non-treated epilepsy. At the ED, he was febrile (tympanic temperature of 40.7oC) and hypotensive (blood pressure 90/56 mmHg), with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15 and oxygen saturation of 97%. He presented painless lymphadenopathy in the right posterior cervical area and a mild maculopapular rash on his face without pruritus (Figure 1).

Characteristic colonies and macroconidia of Histoplasma were observed, as described in <PMC11798677_cureus-0017-00000078581-i03_A_1_5.webp><PMC11798677_cureus-0017-00000078581-i03_B_2_5.webp><PMC11798677_cureus-0017-00000078581-i03_C_3_5.webp><PMC11798677_cureus-0017-00000078581-i03_D_4_5.webp><PMC11798677_cureus-0017-00000078581-i03_E_5_5.webp>. DNA Sanger sequencing was performed to achieve a more accurate identification. The combination of the highest identity, total score and query values identifies the species as a H. capsulatum. The definitive diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by the cultural isolation of H. capsulatum from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample and a positive Histoplasma urinary antigen (2022).\nDuring the patient's stay in the ICU, he was also diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and, therefore, started on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (adjusted to renal function) and corticosteroid therapy. Lip biopsy was positive for type 1 herpes simplex infection. In addition, oral nystatin, acyclovir and antiretrovirals (emtricitabine/tenofovir + dolutegravir) were also prescribed. The patient evolved favourably, gradually improving his organ dysfunction. The table shows the evolution during hospitalisation (Table 1).\nThe patient completed 14 days of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B treatment, followed by a transition to oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily on the 15th day of hospitalisation. This oral itraconazole regimen was continued until the Histoplasma urinary antigen test became negative (2024). He also completed 21 days of therapy for pneumocystosis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, maintaining a secondary prophylaxis regimen (double-strength tablet dose) for another 16 months, until CD4+ T lymphocytes count >= 200 cells/mm3 for >3 consecutive months. Newly onset fever with no infection foci developed after suspending corticosteroid therapy and with a notable recovery in CD4+ T lymphocytes count from 32 to 161 cells/mm3 (10.4-25.3%), and an undetectable HIV viral load was interpreted as an Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), so methylprednisolone was restarted on a slow weaning schedule. At that time, the patient had been using antiretrovirals (emtricitabine/tenofovir + dolutegravir) for 20 days. Upon discharge, after a 31-day hospitalisation, the patient was hemodynamically stable, without recurrence of fever, respiratory failure, or other persistent symptoms and normal kidney and liver functions. Outpatient follow-up revealed sustained virological response to antiretroviral therapy (high adherence to the regimen), with undetectable HIV viral load, increasing CD4+ T lymphocyte count and complete resolution of histoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections.",

The patient had a history of laparoscopic RYGB 2 years before her pregnancy, which was uneventful. The body mass index (BMI) of the patient was 40 kg/m2 prior her surgery, and the surgery led to loss of all her excess weight. Patient's BMI was 20 kg/m2 at the beginning of her pregnancy.\nOn examination, the vital signs included, a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, a pulse rate of 120 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, and an axillary temperature of 37.4 C. The abdominal examination was consistent with a 23-week pregnancy. Severe tenderness at the epigastric region was detected, without rebound tenderness and guarding. Blood chemistry including complete blood count, liver function tests, amylase, and lipase were in normal range. An ultrasound was obtained to investigate the pregnancy status. It revealed 23-week dichorionic diamniotic normal fetuses with normal heart rates. The presentation of twins was variable, and the placenta was fundal. The ultrasonographic assessment of the abdomen revealed a round hypoechoic structure and target sign; therefore, the intussusception of small bowel was suspected. As the patient reported worsening of the hematemesis, endoscopy was suggested. On endoscopy, linear ulcer at anastomotic site of stomach was noticed. Since intussusception was suspected on ultrasound, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. On CT scan telescoping bowel segments adjacent to suture lines in jejunum, with dilation of the proximal intestine was observed (Figure 1).",

    "clinical_text": "A 2-year-old male neutered Siamese cat, weighing 4.0 kg, was referred to the Valentine Charlton Cat Centre with a 2 day history of weakness, open-mouth breathing and inappetence. Since the age of 8 months, the cat had been treated by the primary veterinarian for suspected anxiety with fluoxetine (Reconcile, 4 mg PO q24h; Elanco).\nOn examination, the cat had a poor body condition (body condition score 4/9), cyanotic oral mucous membranes and a grade II/VI systolic heart murmur with sternal peak murmur intensity. Open-mouth breathing was intermittent, and was exacerbated by stress and handling. Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 85-88% and did not improve after nasal catheter oxygen supplementation (0.5 l/min). The packed cell volume (PCV) was 48 (reference range 30-45 l/l) and total plasma protein (TPP) was 90 (reference range 59-78 g/l). On three-view thoracic radiographs, the vertebral heart size (VHS) was 7.9 (upper limit of reference range 8.0), and the pulmonary lobar arteries were dilated and tortuous (Figures 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed narrow QRS complexes with deep S-waves and right axis deviation suggestive of right-sided cardiac enlargement. Echocardiography revealed severe right ventricular (RV) concentric hypertrophy (RV diastolic free wall measurement 6.4 mm, left ventricular diastolic free wall measurement 5.8 mm), with paradoxical intervertebral septum motion. The right atrium was subjectively severely enlarged, and there was severe dilation of the main pulmonary artery (PA) and right PA branch (PA:aorta ratio 1.9) (Figures 3 and 4). An insufficiency jet between the dilated PA and RV measured across the pulmonic valve was 4.1 m/s (estimated peak instantaneous diastolic pressure gradient of 68 mmHg), consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) (Figures 5 and 6). A 5.7 mm atrial septal defect (ASD) was identified with right-to-left shunting on colour Doppler, with a maximum velocity of approximately 0.45 m/s (estimated peak instantaneous pressure gradient of 0.81 mmHg) (Figure 4). An agitated saline microbubble contrast study performed via the left cephalic vein confirmed a right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum.\nThe cat was diagnosed with ASD and suspected pulmonary vascular obstructive disease leading to PH (Eisenmenger's syndrome). Symptomatic treatment for PH to alleviate right-to-left shunting was commenced with sildenafil (0.25 mg/kg PO q12h). A low dose was chosen because of the unknown pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in cats with heart disease, especially considering that cats often vary in their ability to metabolise drugs when compared with other species.\nAfter an initial increase in activity and resolution of dyspnoea lasting approximately 2 weeks, the cat became more lethargic with short episodes of open-mouth breathing when anxious or excited. The dose of sildenafil was increased to 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h. At re-evaluation 5 weeks after presentation, the cat was reported to have had fewer episodes of open-mouth breathing that lasted for shorter periods than before treatment. The owners also reported increased activity. PCV was 38 and TPP was 82 g/l. Pulse oximetry revealed an SpO2 on room air of 80%. Repeat echocardiograph showed bidirectional shunting (with some left-to-right flow), and subjectively less right-to-left shunting.\nThree and a half months after initial presentation, the cat developed recurrent respiratory distress following the introduction of a new kitten to the household. The episode consisted of a prolonged episode of open-mouth breathing and weakness that lasted several minutes. The cat had also developed progressive intermittent coughing and wheezing prior to presentation. Repeat radiographs showed persistent dilated, tortuous pulmonary lobar arteries, and that cardiomegaly had progressed (VHS increased to 9.0). The cardiomegaly was considered to be most likely due to ongoing RV hypertrophy and right atrial dilation secondary to severe PH. In addition, there was a subtle bilateral bronchointerstitial pattern throughout the lung fields, suggestive of a component of airway disease contributing to the coughing and wheezing, such as allergic airway disease (considered the most likely given the signalment and history). Less likely considerations included lungworm, neoplasia or mild primary bronchopneumonia. The patient's anaesthetic risk was considered significant, and the owners elected not to proceed with bronchoalveolar lavage to further investigate primary respiratory disease. Empirical treatment was commenced with doxycycline (6.5 mg/kg PO q12h) to treat potential secondary bacterial infection. An echocardiogram and agitated saline microbubble contrast study showed significant right-to-left shunting. The sildenafil dose was increased to 0.75 mg/kg PO q12h (2.8 mg PO q12h). The owners reported a reduction in both open-mouth breathing and coughing/wheezing.\nThe patient remained relatively stable for a further 4.5 months. At 8 months after initial presentation the cat deteriorated again, having several episodes of collapse and open-mouth breathing over the course of a week. These episodes occurred following exercise or play. Clinical examination revealed jugular pulses extending halfway up the neck. An echocardiographic study revealed further advancement of right-sided heart enlargement (RV diastolic free wall measurement 7.94 mm). The insufficiency jet measured across the tricuspid valve had a velocity of 3.34 m/s, which equated to a pressure gradient of 45 mmHg and an estimated RV diastolic pressure of 55 mmHg. Sildenafil was increased to 6.25 mg PO q12h (1.6 mg/kg PO q12h). However, 2 months after this re-evaluation (a total of 10 months after diagnosis), the cat became persistently lethargic and had multiple syncopal episodes, accompanied by loss of faecal and urinary continence, within a week. The owners elected euthanasia and declined necropsy.",

Her grandfather was 167 cm tall, and her grandmother, who had an early menarche at 9 years old, was 147 cm tall.\nGenes panel analysis indicated that the proband had a novel MKRN3 gene mutation (Figure 1A). Her mutation was a point mutation (c.G277A) in exon1 of the MKRN3 gene which leads to glycine (G) being substituted with serine (S) at condon 93 (p.Gly93Ser) (Figures 1B, 2A). Further Sanger sequencing exhibited that her father had the same mutation, and no MKRN3 gene mutation was found in her mother (Figure 1B).\nWe used several in silico computational algorithms (Polyphen2, SIFT, and Mutation Taster) to predict the protein function. PolyPhen-2 classified the variant as \"probably damaging\" with a score of 1, while SIFT predicted that the mutation was neutral, and Mutation Taster thought it was a polymorphism.\nThe point mutation (p.G93S) is near the C3H domain of the MKRN3 protein (Figure 2A). As revealed by a previous study, CPP-associated mutations compromise the auto-ubiquitination of MKRN3 (Abreu et al.,; Li C. Y. et al.,). Our study found that the ubiquitination of wild-type MKRN3 protein was more significant than that of the disease-associated mutant (G93S) in HEK293T cells (Figure 2B), and protein stability detected by immunoblotting analysis indicated that wild-type MKRN3 was less stable than the G93S mutant (Figure 2C).\nTo study the function of wild-type and mutant MKRN3, luciferase reporter vectors for human GNRH1, KISS1, and TAC3 gene promoters were constructed, and the miniCMV promoter acted as a negative control (Figure 3A). As showed in Figure 3B, MKRN3 showed little activity on the miniCMV promoter. Compared to wild-type MKRN3, the G93S mutant led to weaker suppression of the transcriptional activity of the GNRH1, KISS1, and TAC3 promoters, as revealed in Figures 3C-E. In GT1-7 cells that were derived from mouse hypothalamic GnRH-positive neurons, wild-type MKRN3 significantly repressed the protein level of GnRH1, while the G93S mutant lost this effect (Figure 3F).",

    "clinical_text": "Serum samples from a mother and her infant, who had NH, were obtained. This was the first pregnancy of a 27-year-old of Eastern European origin with no significant medical history complicated by oligohydramnios, symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation, and reduced fetal movements. After spontaneous labour at term she was delivered vaginally of a boy weighing 2.270 kg (small for gestational age; < second centile) with a head circumference of 33 cm (<0.4 centile). Apgar scores were not recorded and the placenta was not examined; the infant was described as in good condition. Left hip dislocation was noted.\nEvaluation for poor feeding and hypoglycaemia at age 2 days identified jaundice with coagulopathy [INR 2.3, normal value (nv) <1.2], resistant to parenteral vitamin K. Liver synthetic function was poor [serum albumin 22 g/L, normal range (nr): 35-50]. Indices of hepatic and renal function declined despite treatment for presumed sepsis and the boy was transferred to the Paediatric Liver Centre at King's College Hospital at 7 days of age. NH was suspected in view of the patient's age, history, and clinical-laboratory test results [serum ferritin 1481 ng/mL (nr: 20-300), INR 5.37, albumin 26 g/L, AST 44 IU/L (nr: 10-50), ALT 30 IU/L (nr: 10-50), and total bilirubin 292 mumol/L (nr: 3-20)]. Before blood transfusion, total iron binding capacity was 28 mumol/l (nr: 50-72) and transferrin saturation was 72% (nr: 20-50%) in peripheral-blood serum. Serum immunoglobulin concentrations were IgG, 5.53 g/L (nr: 5-13); IgM, 0.63 g/L (nr: 0.05-0.2); and IgA, 0.63 g/L (nr: 0.01-0.08). Autoantibody testing by indirect immunofluorescence and molecular assays revealed the presence of PBC-specific AMA in serum from the child and his mother (see below).\nThe diagnosis of NH was confirmed at 12 days of age by microscopy of a lower lip mucosa biopsy specimen, which found haemosiderin granules within submucosal acinar gland cells (Figure 1). He was treated with intravenous desferrioxamine, sodium selenite pentahydrate, and N-acetylcysteine and was supported with blood and blood-product transfusions. At age 10 and 16 days he was given intravenous immunoglobulin (0.5 g/kg), and at 21 days he underwent single-volume exchange transfusion.\nPoor clinical status prompted listing for liver transplantation (LT) at age 12 days. He received a cytomegalovirus mismatched (donor+/recipient-) split liver allograft at age 30 days. Examination of the explanted liver found postnecrotic cirrhosis with canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis (Figure 2).\nHe made a slow but steady recovery. Following an isolated episode of lip smacking, and in view of microcephaly he underwent full neurological assessment, which found no cause for seizures; magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated normal brain structures with turricephaly. He was discharged home aged 92 days, 2 months after LT. Hip dislocation was successfully treated at age 10 months with reduction and casting. Allergy to milk, wheat, and egg antigens was diagnosed at age 13 months during evaluation of an urticarial rash. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was diagnosed at age 16 months (EBV DNA 136,907 copies/mL, blood) and at age 19 months upper respiratory tract infection accompanied fever and widespread lymphoadenopathy (EBV DNA 3,653,748 copies/mL). Adjustment in immunosuppressive regimen was rapidly followed by clinical improvement. Development was normal at age 22 months, without clinical-biochemistry evidence of hepatobiliary disease, although EBV viraemia persisted (EBV DNA 2,169,653 copies/mL). \nSerum samples obtained from the child at presentation and over the 17 months thereafter (including samples before and after LT) and from the mother at diagnosis of NH in the infant and 4 and 10 months after giving birth were tested for autoantibodies. An informed consent was obtained. Autoantibody testing complied with the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. Samples were stored at -80 C until use.\nAutoantibodies were sought by indirect immunofluorescence (IFL) using as substrate rat liver/kidney/stomach tissue (KSL Slide, INOVA, San Diego, CA) and human epithelial (HEp-2) cells (INOVA) at a starting serum dilution of 1/20 to extinction. Autoantibodies to liver and nuclear antigens were tested by a combination of immunoassays including ELISAs (INOVA; EUROIMMUN, Lubeck, Germany), multiparametric line immunoassay (EUROIMMUN), and Western blot. These assays were based on purified M2 (AMA) antigen from porcine heart mitochondria; on individual human recombinant E2 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), branched chain oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC), and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) expressed in a baculovirus system (DIARECT, Freiburg, Germany); or on extracts from primate liver or from HEp-2 cell nuclei, as described.\nAMA was initially detected by IFL. It was then characterised by line immunoassay and by an MIT3 ELISA whose target is a hybrid molecule comprising the major epitopes of PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, and OGDC-E2 combined with native M2 antigen (M2-3E ELISA, EUROIMMUN). To investigate the specificity of the AMA response, reactivity against PBC-specific mitochondrial autoantigens was tested by in house ELISAs. These used recombinant PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, and OGDC-E2 antigens (DIARECT) as individual targets. Briefly, wells of a flat-bottom plate (MaxiSorp, NUNC, Thermo Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated in triplicate with individual PDC-E2 (1 mug/mL), BCOADC-E2 (1 mug/mL), and OGDC-E2 (2 mug/mL) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Coylton, Ayrshire, UK) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37 C for 1 h. After a blocking step with 2% BSA for 1 h followed by 3 washes, serum samples (1/100) in 0.1% PBS/Tween20 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the coated wells and the plates were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature on a shaker. After washing (3x), a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (INOVA) was added. The plates were held at room temperature for 45 minutes and the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine (INOVA) was added. The plates were then kept at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Reaction was terminated with 100 muL/well of 4N H2SO4 and absorbance (optical density, OD) at 450 nm was read against blank wells in a microplate reader (MRX, Dynex Technologies). \nIgG subclass-specific anti-PDC-E2 reactivity was investigated by in-house ELISAs, using horseradish peroxidase-labelled anti-IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL), as described. Each sample was tested in triplicate and the mean optical density was calculated.",

    "clinical_text": "A 70-year-old white man, born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, visited for a consultation about a localized swelling on the tip of his nose and an external orifice with serosanguineous discharge (fig. 1, fig. 2). Our initial hypothesis was a furuncular myiasis, since the patient had been to a rural area and had lived in a heavily wooded area with a plantation. The patient was treated with a single dose of 18 mg ivermectin, which was repeated 1 week later.\nWhen he returned 2 months later, his clinical status was unchanged. Although it did not look like a sebaceous cyst, the orifice produced a sebaceous secretion. At this point, an excisional biopsy was performed, removing a large part of the lesion followed by curettage. Histopathology showed follicular hyperkeratosis and, in the dermis, prominent sebaceous glands, telangiectasic capillaries, and a diffuse mononuclear inflammatory reaction. Also, a 'cystically' dilated infundibular structure was observed, whose wall showed squamous cell proliferation with wide eosinophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli as well as extensive dyskeratosis-forming masses of cells with areas of necrosis. This histopathological picture was interpreted as suggestive of adnexal neoplasia with pilar differentiation and a possible proliferating epidermoid cyst (fig. 3, fig. 4, fig. 5).\nThe lesion had already relapsed 45 days later, and another surgery was performed (<PMC3806685_cde-0005-0248-g06_undivided_1_1.webp>). This time, part of the alar cartilage was removed and the reconstruction was done with a dorsal nasal flap. Histopathology showed a complete excision of the lesion. The patient has been monitored since then without a recurrence of the lesion (fig. 7).\nAfter the last surgery, prostate cancer was diagnosed, and the patient was submitted to radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy. After this surgery, he suffered from deep vein thrombosis and needed to take anticoagulants. He also had intestinal cancer, making the removal of 25 cm of the large bowel necessary.

    "clinical_text": "In April 2021, a 57-year-old male patient, with a height of 165 cm and a weight of 67 kg, had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 24.61 kg/m2 (which is above the normal range of 18.5 to 23.9 kg/m2) and was admitted for surgical intervention due to a lumbar vertebral fracture sustained from a traumatic event. During the surgical procedure, he tested positive for hepatitis B markers, specifically for the hepatitis B surface antigen, and had elevated quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen levels, though the exact values were not provided. An abdominal ultrasound revealed liver cirrhosis, leading to the initiation of oral antiviral treatment with entecavir. In October 2022, during routine follow-up, the patient presented with elevated abnormal prothrombin levels (PIVKA-II). Due to the patient's treatment at an external facility, the specific values were not recorded and are currently unobtainable. A contrast-enhanced ultrasound indicated the presence of regenerative nodules in the liver. This prompted a recommendation for further magnetic resonance imaging using the hepatobiliary-specific contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA (Primovist) to rule out malignant liver tumors; however, the patient declined this additional examination due to financial constraints. By April 2023, his abnormal prothrombin level had escalated to 951.94 mAU/mL, significantly above the normal range of 15.40-43.56 mAU/mL. A subsequent contrast ultrasound indicated multiple high-echo lesions in the liver, which were tentatively diagnosed as regenerative nodules, and he continued his antiviral treatment with entecavir.\nTwo months before his admission, the patient experienced symptoms including abdominal distension, fatigue, decreased appetite, yellowing of urine, and occasional nausea. These symptoms prompted his admission to the Department of Hepatobiliary, Pancreatic, and Transplant Surgery at Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Affiliated Hospital on June 12, 2023. The patient has a smoking history spanning over 20 years, during which he smoked approximately 15 cigarettes daily, and he consumed a small amount of alcohol. The impact of smoking and alcohol on liver disease progression is significant; both are known risk factors that can exacerbate liver conditions and may affect response to antiviral treatment. However, he has been abstinent from both for the past two years. He reported no history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or diabetes, and he also denied any previous infectious diseases, significant surgical procedures, blood transfusions, or allergies to drugs or food. Furthermore, he did not report any exposure to epidemic areas, contaminated water, hazardous chemicals, or radioactive materials.\nUpon admission, further examinations confirmed a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, which was specifically moderately differentiated (Stage IVA, T3N1M0). On June 27, 2023, the patient underwent radical surgery for cholangiocarcinoma, which involved liver resection due to porta hepatis ossification, bile duct resection, left liver lobe resection, and biliary-enteric anastomosis, and exhibited satisfactory postoperative recovery. From July 23, 2023, he commenced targeted therapy with 8 mg of lenvatinib capsules twice daily, followed by immunotherapy with an injection of Envafolimab (400 mg, subcutaneous injection). Envafolimab was administered over 10 cycles, on specific dates: August 24, September 20, October 24, December 23, January 15, February 5 and 26, March 15, and April 9 of 2024. Each dose of Envafolimab was 400 mg, administered via subcutaneous injection. A follow-up CT on November 27, 2023, indicated a newly developed abnormal enhancing nodule at the liver apex compared to the scan on September 20 ( Figure 1 ). Subsequently, on December 22, 2023, he underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), receiving treatment with \"Oxaliplatin 50 mg, Levoleucovorin 100 mg, and Fluorouracil 250 mg.\" By February 26, 2024, the patient's fasting blood glucose and glycated albumin levels remained within normal reference ranges ( Figure 2 ).\nOn April 12, 2024, the patient presented with dry mouth and increased thirst, alongside fatigue, prompting his readmission to the Department of Hepatobiliary, Pancreatic, and Transplant Surgery. Physical examination revealed a height of 165 cm and weight of 58 kg (approximately a 9 kg weight loss over the past month), with a BMI of 21.30 kg/m2. Vital signs included T: 36.5 C, P: 67 beats/min, R: 16 breaths/min, and a blood pressure: 119/82 mmHg. Admission laboratory tests revealed random fingertip blood glucose levels of 29.3 mmol/L and random venous blood glucose levels of 30.73 mmol/L ( Figure 2 ), along with a glycated albumin at 28.25% and HbA1c of 8.74%. Urinalysis showed a urine glucose level of 4+ and a urine ketones level of 3+. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated a blood pH of 7.227 and a pCO2 of 27.6 mmHg. He was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and received a continuous intravenous insulin infusion at a rate of 4-5 U/h, with blood glucose levels monitored every 1-2 hours and adjustments made to the insulin administration rate and dosage accordingly. Supportive treatments including rehydration and correction of ketoacidosis were also initiated. After correction of acidosis, the patient was transferred to the endocrinology department for continued glycemic management, receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (aspart insulin) with a basal dose of 15.6 U/day and prandial doses of 5 U before each meal, with blood glucose levels monitored for insulin dose adjustments. Once glycemic control was stabilized, fasting C-peptide levels were measured at 0.04 ng/ml, and postprandial 2-hour C-peptide levels at 0.03 ng/ml; all five insulin autoantibody tests were negative. Considering the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, such as C-peptide, HbA1c, ketones, and pH values, he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes combined with diabetic ketoacidosis, which was thought to be induced by the immune checkpoint inhibitor, Envafolimab. Main diagnostic and endocrine-related indicators during hospitalization are summarized in  Table 1 .  Figure 3  illustrates the timeline of Envafolimab treatment and the onset of T1DM with DKA.\nFollowing successful glycemic control, the patient was discharged with a regimen of 12 U of degludec insulin for subcutaneous injection at bedtime, combined with aspart insulin (5 U, 5 U, 2 U) before each meal. At a two-month follow-up in the outpatient setting, fasting blood glucose levels were recorded at 11.49 mmol/L ( Figure 2 ), with postprandial 2-hour glucose fluctuations between 8.5 and 20.3 mmol/L and glycated albumin at 29.81%. Repeat fasting C-peptide levels were <0.01 ng/ml, and postprandial 2-hour C-peptide levels were also <0.01 ng/ml, prompting further adjustments to insulin dosages. The pharmacist provided medication education, and the patient continues to be monitored during specialized outpatient follow-ups.",

These findings have defined the progression to the systemic form and chemotherapy was begun with prednisone and vinblastine, according to that set forth in the LCH-2009 protocol.\nIn the fifth week of treatment, the patient developed suppurative otorrhea in the right ear without general symptoms. It was difficult to establish whether there was progression of disease with extension to another organ (bone), whether the clinical picture was secondary to otitis externa due to the disease itself or whether the picture was of infectious nature. The infant was hospitalized and treated with cefepima, producing a good response and complete resolution of the lesion after seven days of treatment. The final diagnosis was necrotizing otitis externa.\nIn the sixth week the patient was classified as \"stable disease with involvement of target organ\", and the protocol was followed as planned, with intravenous chemotherapy for six more weeks.\nIn the 12th week reassessment, there were signs of progression of the disease, with a worsening of the skin lesions and hematological parameters. The examination showed ulcerated lesions in the lower abdomen and inguinal region, crusted lesions in the pinna and retroauricular regions. According to the LCH-2009 protocol, the patient was hospitalized and underwent salvage chemotherapy (cladribine + cytarabine). The patient presented infectious complications and severe pancytopenia, leading to the patient's admission to the ICU. The patient also continued to develop hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent otitis.

Her last seizure activity was several years prior to our encounter. Other medications include duloxetine 30 mg BID, which the patient takes for anxiety and ibuprofen as needed for back pain.\nDespite long-term stability, she experienced a 5-10-min episode of convulsions, hand twisting, and frothing at the mouth, followed by 15 min of unresponsiveness witnessed by her daughter.

The patient underwent further testing including an adrenal challenge test, growth hormone deficiency work-up and a video continuous electroencephalogram which were all unremarkable. The antiepileptics levels were also within normal limits.\nThe patient's episode was further complicated by the fact that initial non-contrast Computed tomography (CT) imaging did not reveal any acute conditions. This makes the case particularly challenging, as both seizures and hypoglycemia persisted despite multiple treatments, and no clear underlying cause could be established even after extensive testing.\nA carnitine level was then ordered and revealed a deficiency of free and total carnitine.\nThe patient's valproic acid was discontinued and she was started on l-carnitine supplementation.

She was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma grade 1 by biopsy of cervical lymphadenopathy (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The fusion gene IgH-BCL2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a bone marrow examination. These suggested the bone marrow invasion by FL and we determined the clinical stage was IV, but the patient was followed closely without chemotherapy due to no symptoms. Plasma cells were 6.4% of this bone marrow specimen. In 2021, an increase in soluble interleukin 2 receptors (sIL2R: 834 U/mL) and beta2 microglobulin (beta2MG: 3.54 mg/L) was observed. An enlarging swelling of lymph nodes was also observed by computed tomography (CT). The patient had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4 x 103/muL, a red blood cell (RBC) count of 3.99 x 106/muL, a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 12.2 g/dl, a platelet count (PLT) of 7.4 x 104/muL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 181 U/L at the time of the treatment. A bone marrow examination and immunoelectrophoresis, therefore, were performed for reassessment. Immunoelectrophoresis was positive for immunoglobulin G-kappa (IgG-k), and the presence of neoplastic plasma cells was suspected. A bone marrow examination was performed to confirm IgH-BCL2 positivity. Furthermore, infiltration of B lymphocytes, nuclear enlargement, and 12.2% of multinucleated plasma cells were observed (Figure 2(a)). Serum calcium and creatine albumin levels were within normal limits, the osteolytic lesion was not visible in both CT and positron emission tomography (PET), and the free light chain (FLC) kappa/lambda ratio was 28.17 (501/17 mg/L). Although there were more dysplastic plasma cells, these results suggested the FL was complicated with smoldering MM (by IMWG criteria). These results showed that thrombocytopenia was due to FL in this case. Both lymphocytes and plasma cells were found to be BCL2-positive by immunostaining (Figure 2(b)). These observations indicated a follicular lymphoma complication with myeloma. The bone marrow specimen in 2016 was restained, and both lymphocytes and plasma cells were also found to be BCL2-positive (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). In the bone marrow specimen from 2021, CD3-positive cells were observed around the plasma cells. These T-cells were mostly CD8-positive T-cells, wherein CD4-positive cells did not increase in number (Figures 3(a)-3(c)).\nFor the present case, rituximab at 375 mg/m2 (day 1) and bendamustine at 90 mg/m2 (days 2, 3) were administered in four courses for follicular lymphoma.

However, IgG remained around 3000 mg/dL, the FLC kappa/lambda ratio was 24.95 (297/11.9 mg/L), plasma cells were 16.0% after treatment, and no therapeutic effect of rituximab and bendamustine for smoldering MM was observed.",

    "clinical_text": "The literature on autoimmunity and pregnancy is limited. In most cases, GDM is characterized by a higher insulin resistance and lower insulin secretion, both of which are defects typical of type 2 diabetes. Women with GDM are consequently believed to be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive, however, so:although type 1 diabetes generally develops in younger people (under 30 years old):we need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy. \nIn our personal experience, these are the first cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes occurring during pregnancy and our findings confirm the importance of identifying the risk of patients developing this type of diabetes. \nMost studies have demonstrated that the presence of diabetes-related autoimmunity in patients with GDM predicts the occurrence of type 1 diabetes; the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). Fuchtenbusch et al. have reported that two years after delivery the risk was 17% with one antibody, 31% with two antibodies, and 84% with three antibodies positivity. In the study of Nilsson et al., 83% of the patients with GDM and positivity for at least one autoantibody developed type 1 diabetes 4 years after delivery. Moreover, GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction.\nIn addition, it has been found out that women with GDM and autoantibodies more frequently need insulin therapy; however, it has to be underlined that these patients are younger than those included in our case reports.\nUp to now there are not guidelines about which patients should be checked for autoantibodies. According to our experience, we suggest that women with GDM showing clinical features as no family history of diabetes, normal pre-pregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy in the early weeks of pregnancy, and age higher than 35 years, shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity.\nPregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications of this form of diabetes developing during the pregnancy and, very importantly, the acute onset of diabetes afterwards. Women found anti-GAD positive should be considered at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes and should consequently be regarded as potential future candidates for immunomodulatory strategies.",

    "description": "Re-assessment of a developmental neurotoxicity study of Chlorpyrifos, focusing on statistical challenges in interpreting cerebellum height and brain weight ratios in F1 generation animal models.",
    "clinical_text": "A real case example might be helpful to demonstrate how R can be used to re-assess data for toxicological insight.\nMie et al. (2018) previously reviewed a regulatory developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) study conducted with the insecticide Chlorpyrifos. It was suggested that changes in cerebellum height and cerebellum height relative to brain weight would indicate a DNT effect for Chlorpyrifos. While there appeared no effects in the high-dose group for cerebellum height relative to brain weight, the effects in the low- and mid-dose groups were pronounced and statistically significant. Juberg et al. (2019) previously refuted the assessment of Mie et al. (2018). Unfortunately, the data set cannot be shared with the readers, as it is propriatary information not owned by the authors' institutions. However, the approach itself is generic and suitable for similar cases.\nFigure 6(Fig. 6) is reproduced from Mie et al. (2018) and now also includes individual values. Notable are extreme values and differences in variation for cerebellum height between treatment groups for males, driven by two animals. Superimposed are mean values and the standard deviation by adding a custom layer to the normal scatter plot from ggplot2. This approach allows the addition of summary statistics relevant to the assessment, others could be percentiles.\n Adding a custom function to a ggplot2 \n stat_summary(geom = \"pointrange\",\n fun = \"mean\",\n fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),\n fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),\n color=\"black\", shape=4)\nFor Figure 6A(Fig. 6), Mie et al. (2018) reported that the 1 mg/kg bw/day dose was statistically significantly different to control for females and the 5 mg/kg bw/day different to control for males, according to a Dunnett test. \nFor Figure 6B(Fig. 6), the 0.3 and 1 mg/kg bw/day doses were different to control for both sexes, while the top dose was not. \nThe previous statistical analysis is not replicated here for the following reasons. \n1) For cerebellum height, the homoscedasticity assumption might be scrutinized, at least for males. \n2) Cerebellum height to brain weight is a ratio, which can be easily biased by effects on either factor and when they correlate the assessment of their ratio may become meaningless (Curran-Everett, 2013). In fact, the curious u-shaped dose-response and the lack of effect for the high-dose group for both sexes strongly suggest the presence of a confounding effect. \n3) There is an issue with generic statistical testing as a single decision criterion (Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016), especially when using small group sizes where individual response values have much influence on the assessment. \n4) In practice, it makes sense to compare responses not only to the concurrent control mean but also to relevance thresholds, for example based on historical control data, on the one hand to identify biological relevance of effects and on the other to address the multiple comparison problem. Unfortunately, historical control data for cerebellum height are scarce. \n5) There is the limitation that the litters of the F1 generation pups cannot be reproduced from the data available to the authors. There might be a genetic predisposition with regard to brain morphology, which is not captured or accounted for in a classical Dunnett-type statistical analysis. Hence, it is unclear whether the extreme responses are observed in pups that come from the same litter and whether the variation is appropriately modeled by a simple linear model. For example, the animal numbers of the minimum and maximum response for cerebellum height in the high-dose male group are 104 and 108, respectively. Considering subsequent numbering and a mean litter size of 13 pups/litter in that treatment group, the pups are likely to come from the same litter. A mixed-model that consideres both within and between litter variation would then presumably not find a significant effect for that treatment group for cerebellum height. Also, if the historical background variation is not considered, it is unclear whether such a variation is in itself a toxicologically relevant effect or common/normal.\nDue to this uncertainty, a more abstract and holistic approach may be applied. This may have benefits if statistical model assumptions are violated (Kluxen and Jensen, 2021). Ratios and confounding can be investigated by simple scatterplotting, as proposed for investigating relative organ weights (Kluxen, 2019) but can also be applied on other measures (Bomann et al., 2021). This approach has the obvious limitation that no associated uncertainty is estimated for the assessment.\n Scatterplotting to investigate rates, confounders or relative organ weights \nchlorpyrifos %>%\n ggplot(aes(x=body_weight, y= organ_weight, color=Dose, shape=Dose)) +\n geom_point()+\n facet_grid(~Sex)\nFigure 7A(Fig. 7) shows a scatterplot of cerebellum height to brain weight. The individual values indicate a direct correlation: animals with a high brain weight also have a higher cerebellum height. The plot shows that the two male high-dose animals that have the lowest cerebellum heights also have the lowest brain weights.\nFigure 7B(Fig. 7) shows a scatterplot of cerebellum height to body weight and (C) brain weight to body weight. The animals with the lowest cerebellum height and brain weight also have the lowest body weight. A simple linear model for the correlation of body and brain weight, ignoring sex and dose, explains 84 % of the variance. The model can be superimposed in the plot by adding: geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", aes(group=1)). This model does not seem to explain more of the available variation when additionally considering dose as a cofactor. \n Simple comparison of linear models \nfit_1 <- chlorpyrifos %>% \n lm(Brain_wt~Body_wt, .)\nfit_2 <- chlorpyrifos %>% \n lm(Brain_wt~Body_wt+as.numeric(Dose), .) \nanova(fit_1, fit_2)\nAnalysis of Variance Table\nModel 1: Brain_wt ~ Body_wt\nModel 2: Brain_wt ~ Body_wt + as.numeric(Dose)\n Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(>F)\n1 46 0.1286 \n2 45 0.1264 1 0.0022034 0.7845 0.3805\nHence, since cerebellum height, brain weight and body weight correlate, an effect on body weight is propagated through the endpoints. This effect is exacerbated when endpoints are assessed in ratios and results in curious dose-response relationships, as seen for cerebellum height to brain weight ratio. \nHere, animals with notably lower cerebellum heights are clearly smaller than other animals. This observation casts doubt on a targeted effect on brain morphology but supports an effect following general maternal toxicity. The relationship of body weight and organ weight is complex (Bailey et al., 2004; Kluxen, 2019) and driven, for example, by the need for a certain organ size to ensure physiological function. This may be even more relevant for the brain and associated endpoints.",

    "clinical_text": "A 67-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia was transferred to our hospital for management of status epilepticus. She had no prior history of seizure, dementia or neuro-psychiatric disorder. Two months prior to presentation, she received CDC recommended vaccinations in anticipation of traveling to Guyana, South America, which included the 17D yellow fever virus (YFV) and Hepatitis B vaccines. Two weeks after vaccination she developed dizziness, double vision, sore throat and low-grade fever which she reported to her primary care provider (PCP). Five weeks later she presented to an outside hospital for evaluation of ongoing disequilibrium, vertical diplopia and numbness of her hands and lips. She was evaluated with a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head which revealed age-related parenchymal atrophy without evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. The following morning, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the head with and without gadolinium-based intravenous (IV) contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck with and without contrast, and electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated a few non-specific white matter changes, but were otherwise unremarkable. Comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and random cortisol were all within normal limits. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed and showed mildly elevated protein but no nucleated cells (Table 1); vitamin B12 levels were low in the 200 pg/mL range and repletion was begun. The patient was discharged home the next day. Three days later, her husband found her aphasic at home and she was taken back to the outside hospital. A repeat non-contrast CT of the head was again unremarkable without evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Her labs were again normal, her aphasia improved and she was discharged home with concern for a functional neurologic disorder. She returned to the outside hospital within 48 h after the husband found her persistently aphasic and minimally interactive with right lower extremity shaking. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxia and increased oral secretions requiring intubation for oxygenation and airway protection. This clinical picture, along with repeat EEG showing diffuse background slowing and \"persistent left periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges suggestive of focal cortical excitability and an increased risk of seizures arising from that region,\" prompted aggressive treatment with administration of levetiracetam and propofol infusion for tube tolerance as well as seizure control. At that time she was transferred to Oregon Health & Science University for continuous EEG monitoring as well as further workup and management.\nOn admission to the Neurosciences ICU (NSICU), the patient was comatose. Her exam was notable for intact cranial nerve reflexes, witnessed rhythmic movement of the right lower extremity, triple flexion to noxious stimulus in both lower extremities, no movement of right upper extremity to noxious stimulus, hyper-reflexia throughout with bilaterally up-going toes and clonus at the right ankle. MRI with and without contrast (Figure 1A) demonstrated new diffusion restriction and mild T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity along the left greater than right paramedian frontal lobes and insular cortices bilaterally as well as within the caudate heads and left lentiform nucleus. There was no associated enhancement or significant mass effect. While the predominantly gray matter signal abnormalities were suspicious for prion disease such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), especially within the context of her EEG findings, given no preceding cognitive dysfunction, the imaging findings were favored to represent sequelae of recent epileptic activity. She received additional levetiracetam and placed on continuous EEG which showed rare epileptiform discharges in the left temporal region as well as bilateral lateralized periodic discharges (L > R) (Figure 2). Repeat LP was performed which appeared non-infectious with lymphocytic pleocytosis, with negative oligoclonal bands, cytology and cytometry. An infectious disease consult was obtained given recent YFV vaccination prior to presentation along with neurology consultation for seizure management and neuro-immunology given concern for potential inflammatory encephalitis. Additional cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to evaluate for YFV antibodies as well as Mayo Clinic Laboratories to evaluate for autoimmune and paraneoplastic autoantibodies. The patient was started on empiric IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.4 mg/kg for 5 days while the remainder of workup was in process given the potential for YEL-AND.\nA repeat MRI on day two of IVIG treatment (Figure 1B) revealed unchanged diffusion restriction and FLAIR signal abnormalities within the paramedian frontal lobes, insular cortices, and basal ganglia. At that time, however, a new patchy T2 and FLAIR hyperintense signal was seen in a symmetric distribution within the subcortical white matter of bilateral occipital lobes and precunei with involvement of the subcortical U-fibers without enhancement or mass effect. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement was also seen at that time, which was attributed to the patient's recent LP. Given the stability of the gray matter signal abnormalities, vCJD and sequelae of status epilepticus remained within the differential diagnosis. Additionally, the distribution of white matter involvement were considered potentially consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. At this point, the decision was made to stop IVIG after three treatments given efficacy equivalence as well as increased risk with extra doses (possible posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome-like picture on MRI, and transaminitis). A CT scan of her chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed no malignancy and paraneoplastic panels were negative.\nThe patient's neurological and respiratory exam slowly improved and she was extubated to high-flow nasal cannula for several days before safe to transition out of the NSICU to the acute care ward. Repeat MRI brain at time of floor transfer (hospital day 16) revealed near-complete interval resolution of the T2 and FLAIR signal abnormalities within the parietal and occipital lobe white matter, decreased diffusion restriction within the basal ganglia, but persistent diffusion restriction within the paramedian frontal and insular cortices. Pachymeningeal enhancement had also resolved, further supporting the prior LP as the etiology for those transient findings. Spot EEG at this time did not show any seizures though it continued to have moderate diffuse slowing as well as subtle focal slowing over the left hemisphere. Her NSICU course was otherwise complicated by Escherichia coli urinary tract infection which was treated with cefepime for 48 h and then narrowed to cephalexin to complete a 7-day course and Streptococcus anginosus bacteremia thought to be from a sinus infection based on CT sinus findings (10 day ampicillin/sulbactam course). Her seizures were well-controlled with levetiracetam 1,000 mg twice daily.\nThe remainder of her labs returned negative or within normal limits, including real-time quaking induced conversion, with the notable exception of: CSF protein 14-3-3 positive and elevated tau protein (>4,000); serum and CSF YFV IgM positive; YFV CSF 90% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) titer 1:256, and a serum PRNT90 titer of 1:640. CSF YFV polymerase chain reaction was not performed by the CDC given time elapsed post-vaccination. Given these results, it was felt that the positive 14-3-3 and tau were due to neuronal damage. The negative RT-QuIC ruled out vCJD. CSF YFV IgM positivity with titer levels close to those in serum confirmed a diagnosis of YEL-AND.\nNeuro-immunology consultants recommended intravenous methylprednisolone at 1,000 mg per day for 5 days with a follow-up brain MRI after completion, which demonstrated continued improvement of the previously noted signal abnormalities with only mild persistent diffusion restriction and FLAIR hyperintensity within the frontal and insular cortices.\nHer hospital recovery was complicated by swallowing apraxia and dysphagia requiring eventual percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, urinary retention requiring indwelling urinary catheterization, excess oral secretions treated with glycopyrrolate, and suspected frontal lobe apathy which improved mildly with low dose methylphenidate. At time of discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, she was awake and oriented with choices, smiled appropriately to jokes but did not attempt spontaneous speech or movement and had dramatic bradyphrenia. She displayed a restricted affect and had positive palmo-mental reflex and grasp reflex in her right hand. She had a mild right lower facial droop, increased tone right-side greater than left with drift in the right upper extremity and reduced strength in all muscle groups on the right. Her reflexes were brisk but symmetric and she had now down-going toes bilaterally. She was able to walk with walker with stooped posture and significant bradykinesia. At discharge, the patient had a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 7/30.\nThe patient completed 4 weeks of intensive inpatient rehabilitation therapy and subsequently went to an adult foster home. She had moderately improved speech fluency and was able to ambulate with walker without support though she had continued significant psychomotor slowing. She was tolerating oral intake but was unable to meet caloric needs due to significant apraxia vs. apathy. At neurology clinic follow up visit 3 months after hospital discharge, MRI showed complete resolution of intracranial abnormalities previously seen. Due to the symptom constellation of bradyphrenia, bradykinesia, restricted affect and prior diffusion restriction in basal ganglia, diagnosis of post-infectious/post-inflammatory parkinsonism was made and she was started on levodopa-carbidopa. This was well-tolerated and increased as indicated over several months with improvement in all above symptoms. The patient has subsequently moved back home and is able to maintain caloric needs without tube feeding. Anti-epileptic therapy was successfully weaned without further seizure activity, frontal release signs (primitive reflexes) were absent on exam and repeat MoCA score were >20 on repeat clinic visits.",

    "clinical_text": "In October 2016, an Italian-speaking, right-handed 64-year-old male, with only eight years of formal education, was referred to our Neurodegenerative Diseases Centre by his family. He presented with a 2-year history of progressive language deficits and impulse control disorders with PG evident from the onset. Before developing PG, the patient was described by his family as being parsimonious and careful with money. Over the two years, he had started to spend his money on gaming machines and scratch cards, squandering his salary and his savings and borrowing money from friends and relatives to continue gambling. From the onset of the disease, the patient also presented semantic deficits and started to use objects inappropriately because he seemed not to recognize them. At initial neurological examination, the patient presented with mild signs of Parkinson's (ie, bradykinesia, hypomimia) and there was a family history of dementia (his father had Alzheimer's disease). In the following month, the patient underwent a neuropsychological assessment that showed an entirely normal cognitive performance, even for executive tasks, with the exception of a slight but not significant impairment in verbal episodic memory that could be related to his lexical-semantic deficits. Activities of daily living were preserved. At the speech-language examination, he showed isolated semantic deficits, ie, impairment in single-word comprehension, nonverbal semantic association, surface dyslexia and word-finding difficulties as assessed by the Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration battery (SAND). At the spontaneous speech task, he showed a low speech rate associated with several false starts and a lot of lexical-semantic errors, ie, word-finding pauses with a tendency to produce high-frequency nouns and poor content resulting in a reduction of information units. The patient's linguistic profile did not report articulatory, phonetic and phonemic errors. PG was confirmed from the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and South Oaks Gambling Screen (Tables 1 and 2). \n MRI brain scans (3 T) showed bilateral (right > left) fronto-temporo-insular and cingulate atrophy (Figure 1, Panels A-B-C); SPECT brain scan showed no right temporal lobe perfusion and hypoperfusion of the bilateral frontal lobes and left cingulate (Figure 2) and DAT-SCAN showed damage to the nigrostriatal dopamine system, ie right putamen, caudate nucleus (right > left) (Figure 3). CSF biomarkers were within the normal range for age (Abeta1-42771 pg/mL; tTau 276 pg/mL; nd 42.79 pg/mL; pTau181: f). Imaging and CSF biomarkers indicated a neurodegenerative process that was not due to amyloidosis (<PMC6497882_CIA-14-727-g0004_undivided_1_1.webp>).\nThe patient was diagnosed as having sv-PPA according to the classification of Gorno-Tempini et al.\nIn November 2017, the language deficit worsened to paragrammatic speech, a low speech rate and reduction of information content. Also, his behavioral changes increasingly worsened with apathy, disinhibition, compulsive/stereotyped behaviors and hyperphagia, as did performance in executive/social cognition abilities, compatible with a frontal lobe dysfunction (Tables 1 and 2).\nThis clinical picture indicated the presence of a second phenotype, behavioral-frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), according to the criteria of Rascovsky et al with associated mild parkinsonism. A diagnosis of fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) was established according to the Lund-Manchester criteria.\nPG was nonresponsive to pharmacological therapy (eg, levodopa) during the course of the disease and was considered a significant clinical finding within the wider spectrum of behavioral symptoms.",

    "clinical_text": "A 74-year-old man visited the emergency department three times in April 2020 due to lower back pain. Computed tomography (CT) disclosed an RVA with a diameter of 48.9 mm. No other potential causes of pain were identified. His medical history included chronic atrial fibrillation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and cerebral infarction. He did not have any history of trauma. Previous CT images that had been obtained for other reasons were reviewed retrospectively and revealed the RVA with a diameter of 17.1 mm in July 2015 and 35.7 mm in September 2019. The aneurysm kept gradually enlarging and had reached 53 mm (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g001_A_1_3.webp>), although the lower back pain had almost disappeared. The aneurysm was approached through the right femoral vein. A catheter was also inserted to the left renal artery (LRA). Anatomical information was obtained by LRA-occluded venography, LRA-unoccluded venography, or delayed venous phase imaging of LRA injection. The neck of the aneurysm appeared to be approximately 12 mm on CT and venography, but it was not clearly shown. There was no arteriovenous fistula (AVF). As a preliminary step, we confirmed these things experimentally. When the aneurysm neck was closed with a 22-mm Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) II (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) with one lobe of the device positioning in the renal vein and two lobes in the aneurysm, the renal vein itself was completely occluded (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g002_A_1_4.webp>). When the neck was closed with a 10-mm AVP II, it did not occlude the renal vein, while the neck was incompletely closed (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g002_B_2_4.webp>). Although an additional plug would be required to completely occlude the neck, placing a 10-mm AVP II in the neck first to restrict blood flow appeared safe and effective. Based on this information, we then moved on to the actual procedure. Two 22-mm AVP II were placed within the aneurysm sac to reduce the empty space and promote thrombus formation in the aneurysm lumen. A 10-mm AVP II was delivered in the neck, but after a while, it turned out to be dislodged into the aneurysm. We tried to place a 16-mm AVP II to close the neck. We confirmed that the venous return from the upper branch could flow through collateral circulation (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g002_C_3_4.webp>) and the return from the lower branch was not obstructed (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g002_D_4_4.webp>). We deployed the 16-mm AVP II. The final angiogram demonstrated complete disappearance of flow into the aneurysmal sac.\nThe patient's course following endovascular treatment (EVT) was uneventful. CT just after the procedure still showed the remnant aneurysm sac (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g001_B_2_3.webp>). The aneurysm shrank and had completely resolved by 12 months after EVT, without any renal vein thrombosis or obstruction (<PMC10766739_avd-16-277-g001_C_3_3.webp>). The patient has remained on direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, and as of nearly 2 years after EVT is doing well without any recurrence.\nThe patient provided consent for publication with the accompanying images, and the ethics board of Nagahama City Hospital approved this therapy and publication in the journal (No. R5-6).",

She denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, irregular bowel habits or hematochezia. She had undergone colonoscopy 10 years prior at an outside facility which according to her had been unremarkable. Her past medical history included migraine, hypertension, coronary artery disease and osteopenia. Her home medications included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, simvastatin, calcium, vitamin D and alendronate. Her family history was significant for stomach cancer in a sister, lung cancer in a brother and thyroid cancer in a daughter. She denied any family history of neurological tumors and cutaneous neurofibromas. She had a 40-pack-year smoking history, which she quit for 12 years. Physical examination revealed an overweight woman with a body mass index of 29. Her abdomen was soft with no tenderness or palpable masses. She did not have any skin lesions or pigmented/hypopigmented spots. Abdominal and neurological exams were within normal limits. Laboratory data revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dl, a white blood cell count of 8,100/mul, a platelet count of 251,000/mul and a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dl. Basic metabolic panel, liver function tests and coagulation profile were within normal limits. Hepatitis serology was negative.\nAs part of routine screening, colonoscopy was performed up to the cecum. Findings included a 20-mm pedunculated polyp with a stalk measuring 0.6 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter in the ascending colon (<PMC3806709_crg-0007-0369-g01_undivided_1_1.webp>), and an 8-mm polyp in the transverse colon removed with polypectomy and a 3-mm polyp in the ascending colon removed with biopsy forceps. Other findings were diverticulosis of the entire colon and internal hemorrhoids. The 8-mm transverse colon polyp revealed tubular adenoma on histopathology, and the 3-mm ascending colon polyp revealed colonic mucosa. Histologically, the pedunculated ascending colon polyp revealed bland spindle cell proliferation in the submucosa (fig. 2, fig. 3). Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cells were immunoreactive to S100 protein (<PMC3806709_crg-0007-0369-g04_undivided_1_1.webp>) and were non-reactive to CD117, SMA and desmin antibodies.

On the third day of hospitalization, pain, redness, and swelling started to develop in the medial right leg. With a prediagnosis of abscess, the patient was treated with clindamycin and amikacin. Chest X-ray revealed a large consolidated area and infiltration in the left lower lobe, an abdominal ultrasound revealed minimal hepatosplenomegaly and bilateral 1-1.5 cm inguinal lymphadenopathy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremities revealed soft tissue edema.\nAfter methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth was detected in the abscess culture, the patient was consulted with us. The patient's general condition was good on physical examination, vital signs were stable, and lung sounds were normal. The patient had 5x3 cm drained abscesses on the medial aspect of the right lower extremity (<PMC11249987_SEMB-58-258-g001_undivided_1_1.webp>), ulcerated abscesses around the necrotic periphery, 3x4 cm reddened abscesses with fluctuations on the dorsum of the right foot, and 2x2 cm abscesses with new onset on the medial aspect of the lower extremity. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility test, the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and teicoplanin. In the patient's follow-up, the right foot's abscess was drained.

She had no pedal edema or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A mass was palpable in the right lumbar region extending to the right hypochondrium and crossing the midline. The mass had an irregular surface and was tender and ballotable.\n The patient had a computerized tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis which showed a large (92 mm x 80 mm x 90 mm) lobulated mixed density renal mass arising from the upper pole and involving the ipsilateral adrenal gland. The extrarenal component indented the inferior and posterior surfaces of the liver. Enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the region of celiac axis, portocaval, and retrocaval area measuring 6 cm in largest diameter. Main renal vein on the left side revealed no definite luminal filling defect. There was narrowing of the IVC. Multiple tiny nodules were noted in the lung parenchyma bilaterally (Figure 1). \nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position with the right flank elevated with sand bag to 30  to facilitate mobilization of the tumour. The skin was prepped from nipple-line to the mid-thigh and patient draped in the usual fashion. A right transverse upper abdominal incision was made from tip of 12th rib crossing the midline 2 cm above the level of the umbilicus and extending to lateral border of the left rectus abdominis muscle. The peritoneal cavity was entered and entire abdomen explored. A firm, irregular brownish-yellow mass measuring 19 cm x 10 cm was found. This had almost completely replaced the right kidney. tumor had infiltrated the Gerota's fascia and was adherent to the inferior surface of the liver. The right renal vein and adjacent IVC wall were infiltrated. There was perihilar and para-aortic lymphadenopathy. However, there was no palpable liver metastasis.\n The colon and duodenum were free.\n Initial renal pedicle control was not possible. Thus, the tumor was mobilized inferiorly and laterally. The superior pole of the tumour was separated from the inferior hepatic surface with careful blunt dissection. The distorted renal vessels were carefully dissected, and divided in between Satinsky vascular clamps. Partial longitudinal resection of the tumor-infiltrated IVC wall was done. This was accompanied by transient hypotension which was controlled by the preinformed anaesthetists.\nThe ureter was then ligated and divided far beyond the level of tumour involvement. The tumour, the adrenal gland, regional lymph nodes, and resected wall of IVC were removed in one block.\nThe renal fossa and inferior hepatic surface were packed as the latter continued to ooze despite efforts at meticulous hemostasis. The pack was removed forty-eight hours postoperatively by the bed side.\n Patient had hypovolemic shock with acute renal failure twelve hours after-surgery. This was successfully managed in conjunction with nephrologists.\n She also had right facial palsy and bilateral pitting pedal edema up to midleg. She was discharged to the clinic ten days later.\nThe gross pathological examination revealed a greyish-brown nodular kidney with the adrenal measuring 18.5 cm x 12 cm x 11 cm and weighing 813 g. The pelvic region showed the stump of the ureter, two ligated blood vessels measuring 1.5 cm and 1.7 cm long, respectively, with external diameter of 0.4 cm (Figure 2).\n Microscopically, the specimen showed renal tissue with large sheets of neoplastic epithelial cells separated by delicate vascular septae. These cells exhibited clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, moderately pleomorphic round to avoid vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and two mitotic figures per high-power field. There were extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis along with foci of dystrophic calcification. Tumour cells were seen in the pelvis of the kidney and in a vascular channel. These are in keeping with right clear cell RCC with vascular invasion; Fuhrman's grade 3.\nThe woman has been regular at clinic followup. She no longer has flank pain, and pedal edema had resolved.\nPostoperative ultrasound demonstrated absent right kidney, normal left kidney, no para-aortic lymphadenopathy and no ascites.",

    "clinical_text": "Our patient is a 76-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, initially presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a three-month history of nausea, vomiting, and occasional diarrhea. She was evaluated by gastroenterology, and an outpatient EGD was performed showing a small hiatal hernia and atrophic gastritis. Within the next few weeks, she presented to ED with acute onset abdominal pain and worsening diarrhea which now appeared to be bloody. A CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was requested for the clinical diagnosis of ischemic colitis. Significant colonic wall thickening and pericolonic inflammatory stranding of the entire colon with sparing of the cecum, concerning for pancolitis with mild ascites, were noted on the initial CT scan (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The gastroenterology team was mostly concerned for noninfectious colitis, namely, ulcerative colitis or ischemic colitis, and boarded her for colonoscopy. Due to the patient's overall condition, comorbidities, and improvement of acute symptoms with supportive care, a colonoscopy was performed three days after admission when she was deemed stable. The results revealed pancolonic diffuse mucosal vascular congestion, pronounced in the rectosigmoid region, with a decreased mucosal vascular pattern. Random biopsies were performed which histopathologically revealed architectural distortion and paneth cell metaplasia, as seen in chronic colitis, without evidence of active colitis, granulomas, crypt abscesses, or dysplasia. The following day, a CTA of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained to evaluate for the possibility of an underlying vascular etiology. CTA showed that diffuse pancolitis slightly improved compared to the prior CT exam four days prior with a normal caliber patent abdominal aorta and proximal mesenteric vasculature. The CTA also displayed tortuous vascular lesions in the IMA territory with early filling veins concerning for AVMs (Figures 2(a)-2(d)). Given the rarity of AVM-induced ischemic colitis, patency of proximal mesenteric vessels, biopsy results suggesting chronic colitis, and overall clinical improvement with supportive therapy and steroids, the clinical suspicion favored ulcerative colitis. Given this presumed diagnosis, steroid therapy was continued and the patient was discharged in stable condition with recommendation for a follow-up in two weeks. At the time of follow-up, the patient had no abdominal symptoms and reported complete improvement.\nApproximately one month later, the patient presented to the emergency department with bilateral lower extremity edema and fatigue. Work-up for the edema revealed bilateral lower extremity DVTs, and the patient was placed on Lovenox. Shortly after, the patient developed several episodes of hematochezia and abdominal pain which prompted MRA of the abdomen, further strengthening the concern for AVMs. The MRA exhibited an inferior mesenteric artery distribution of multiple focal aneurysmal vessels in the left colonic mesentery (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Additionally, MRA displayed mild improvement in the patient's previously noted colitis.\nAt this point, interventional radiology was consulted for a mesenteric angiogram. Arteriogram demonstrated a total of 3 AVMs, each individually supplied by branches of the IMA (Figures 4(a)-4(d)). The left colic artery was divided into two distal omental branches, which were coil embolized prior to Onyx liquid embolic instillation of the left colic artery (Figure 5(a)). The superior rectal artery was divided into two distal branches; both of which supplied the largest of the three AVMs, which was embolized with Onyx injection into the superior rectal artery proximal to both of the aforementioned branches (Figure 5(b)). The sigmoid artery, similar to the left colic, had two distal omental branches that were coil embolized before Onyx liquid embolic instillation (Figure 5(c)). There was an enlarged marginal vein draining into the middle colic vein with increased flow due to the AVMs. Subsequent SMA arteriogram displayed adequate flow to the left colon, sigmoid colon, and superior rectum from collaterals supplied by the marginal artery.\nDuring postprocedural follow-up, the patient denied any abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. The patient demonstrated stability for over 1 year and was without any recurrence of abdominal symptoms.",

    "clinical_text": "A 54-year-old male patient received emergency treatment in our hospital for black stool, chest tightness and fatigue that started more than one month earlier. He was initially diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding and severe anemia due to hemoglobin 39g/L. Next, emergency abdominal CT showed that the gastric antrum cancer should be considered first, recommending the patient to be transferred to the Department of Gastroenterology for follow-up treatment. Then, gastroscopy results showed that the gastroscope smoothly passed through esophagus, the dentate line of cardia was clear, the gastric fundus was smooth, and the mucosa was normal. However, his gastric mucosa was congested, and an enormous ulcer spread from the gastric antrum to the corner of the stomach with irregular upwelling around, ulcerated surface, brittle texture, easy bleeding (biopsy site), and gastroscope could not pass through pylorus in the gastric antrum (Figure 1). Meanwhile, he also underwent gastroscopy biopsy that revealed HER2-negative gastric adenocarcinoma (<PMC6757230_OTT-12-7691-g0002_A_1_3.webp><PMC6757230_OTT-12-7691-g0002_B_2_3.webp><PMC6757230_OTT-12-7691-g0002_C_3_3.webp>). Additionally, abdominal computed tomography (CT) examination in other hospitals showed advanced gastric malignant tumor with multiple distant lymph node metastases, with staging of T4N3M1. Due to severe anemia caused by hemorrhage, the patient received exploratory laparotomy. Unfortunately, the tumor lesion was found to have invaded so widely that lost the opportunity of radical treatment during operation, which was the same as imaging results. Finally, surgeons had to operate gastrojejunostomy for the sake of his life quality, and he was discharged from our hospital with only postoperative symptomatic and supportive treatments.\nPhysical examination showed anemia with stomach upset, which was consistent with laboratory findings. Follow-up positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) depicted that diffuse abnormal thickening of the gastric antrum accompanied by increased metabolism was considered as gastric malignant tumor with extraneous invasion; multiple hypermetabolic enlarged lymph nodes around the pylorus of the gastric antrum, mesenteric root and retroperitoneum were regarded as metastasis, which were divided into IV stages of T4N3M1 (Figure 3A). After a multi-disciplinary consultation, we formulated a treatment plan: SOX regimen palliative chemotherapy combined with PD-1 antibody immunotherapy (Nivolumab, 200 mg, q2w), and synchronous irradiation of gastric lesion (3Gy/8fx) to alleviate local symptoms. The specific treatment schedule was shown in Supplementary figure 1.\nTwo weeks after the injection of Nivolumab, the patient returned to our hospital, reporting that he felt slightly itchy on his thighs, but the symptoms of gastric discomfort were better than before. He insisted on continuing treatment, and after two courses of treatment, the patient volunteered for a PET/CT. The PET/CT revealed a partial response (PR, about a 60% decrease in the total diameters of target lesions compared with the first PET/CT results) of the gastric cancer and lymph node, the morphology of the lesion and metabolism was obviously reduced, but tumor activity remained (Figure 3B), which was in accordance with the RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Combination therapy continued. After four doses of Nivolumab, the patient complained of obvious fever, with the highest temperature of 38 degree Celsius. The condition improved after two days, and the rest had no obvious discomfort. PET/CT scan was performed again after four more doses of Nivolumab. PET/CT examination suggested that PR (the sum of diameters of target lesions decreased by 50% compared with the last PET/CT results), tumor lesions and metabolism were significantly reduced, and the tumor activity was mostly inhibited, while a little tumor activity still left (Figure 3C). The treatment went on wheels according to the original plan. After four more courses of treatment, the patients were evaluated by PET/CT scan again. PET/CT reported that the metabolism of tumor was in a state of complete repression and no obvious tumor signs were observed (Figure 3D). The overall effect was almost complete response (CR).\nDuring the treatment period, the overall patient's condition steadily improved without obvious side effects. The hemogram of outpatient reexamination revealed a temporary increase in the tumor markers in the early stage of immunotherapy, possibly due to the death and lysis of tumor cells, and a steady decline in the later stage (<PMC6757230_OTT-12-7691-g0004_A_1_2.webp><PMC6757230_OTT-12-7691-g0004_B_2_2.webp>). Moreover, the related immune indicators and immune cells in the peripheral blood changed greatly during immunotherapy. On the one hand, TNF-a and IL-6 remained at high levels during immunotherapy, and IL-2 kept a steady rise, while IL-10 showed an exponential decline (Figure 5A). On the other hand, CD3+T cell and CD8+T cell kept a slight decline, but were still at high levels; besides, the level of CD4+T cell consistently increased, which was the same as the rate of CD4+/CD8 (Figure 5B). These phenomena reflected enhancement of overall immune infiltration in tumours and inflammation of tumor microenvironment, which was the proof of the transition of \"hot\" tumor (Figure 5). Until now, the patient is undergoing systemic SOX chemotherapy and Nivolumab. He is still alive and in good condition for 11 months after the initial diagnosis, with PFS expected to be at least 11 months. The treatment is still going on.",

Although there was sensory loss in the left toes, no motor deficits were observed in the left foot. Preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a left popliteal artery occlusion (Figure 1(a)). Cardiovascular assessments, including electrocardiography and echocardiography, showed no major abnormalities. Further investigations also identified no potential embolic sources, such as thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Based on the symptom onset within 2 weeks and the findings of the physical examination, there was a strong suspicion of acute limb ischemia, necessitating prompt revascularization.",

Computed tomography (CT) of the head and CT angiography of the head and neck revealed an unruptured 11.7-millimeter wide-necked left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that was subsequently confirmed with conventional cerebral angiography. She was taken to the operating room where she subsequently had the aneurysm clipped. Intraoperatively, the patient developed profound bleeding due to loss of local hemostasis. As a result, the patient had an episode of pulseless electrical activity, followed by resuscitation and consequent sacrifice of the left vertebral artery.\nPostoperatively, the patient remained intubated due to several episodes of prolonged apnea mainly during sleep, having often to be \"reminded\" to breathe. Initial physical examination was significant for left eye ptosis and meiosis, subtle right gaze preference, and left-sided weakness and ataxia. Noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated increased T1 signal in the left inferior cerebellum and medulla in the PICA vascular distribution. It was noted that, during sleep when on the same ventilator settings as those during wakefulness, the patient became acidotic and was retaining carbon dioxide (CO2), with a partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) of 76 millimeters of mercury, while breathing only at the set rate and not initiating her own breaths. During wakefulness, the patient was able to maintain ventilation, evident by normal PaCO2. Over the course of stay in the intensive care unit, the patient was maintained on different modes of assisted ventilators and eventually continuous positive airway pressure. Consequently, the apneic episodes progressively became shorter until the patient recovered spontaneously before discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility.",

In addition, he experiences episodes of clonic movement in his right leg, facial twitching, and abnormal body movements. Congenital cataracts and these complaints were since birth.\nThe baby was born by a 33 years old multigravida mother via a spontaneous vaginal delivery at a different hospital. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit after requiring oxygen therapy and resuscitation on delivery. On the thirty-fifth day, the patient was referred to us for an additional assessment and treatment.\nNo vaccinations or prenatal care were given to the mother during her pregnancy. The mother experienced skin rashes, headaches, and fever during the initial months of her pregnancy, but she did not seek medical attention at a hospital. She is the mother of three other healthy children. The mother's drug history was limited to analgesics. The baby's parents, who are consanguineous, had no record of inherited medical disorders. Upon examination, the baby appeared ill with generalized hypotonia, respiratory distress, and no signs of cyanosis.\nThe patient's vitals are: HR : 150 bpm, RR : 60 bpm, T : 37.6 OC, SPO2 : 94% in room air, blood sugar : 82 mg/dl, birth weight : 3.55 kg, height : 55 cm, and head circumference : 35.8 cm. The patient exhibited a pink conjunctiva, an anterior fontanel of 1.5x1.5 cm, bilateral cataractous lenses (Figure 1), and involuntary rolling of the eyes. His Chest or respiratory system: Intercostal retractions but has good air entry. Cardiovascular system: Continues machine like murmur at upper left sternal border. Abdomen: no abdominal distension and hepato-splenomegaly. Nervous system: baby was hypotonic but alert, had convulsions, and all of his reflexes were intact except the imperfect moro-reflex. According to the Investigations his full blood count (FBC) of the patient showed WBCs 9x1000/mm3, HB 16.6 g/dl and platelet count 181x1000/mm3, no thrombocytopenia was seen in all tests. The biochemical analysis revealed normal tests for the renal, liver, and thyroid functions, normal calcium, potassium, magnesium, and glucose levels but a slight decrease in sodium levels (129 mmol/l) and albumin (2.7g/dl). The C-reactive protein (CRP) measured 29 mg/l. The coagulation test results were unremarkable. The rubella IgM antibody level in the TORCH infections serology test was found to be elevated at 50.2 AU/mL (Table 1). The serology results were all negative for HSV, CMV, and toxoplasma. Unfortunately, we could not carry out PCR tests at our facility. The chest x-ray of the baby showed Cardiomegaly and mild bilateral lung infiltrates (<PMC11338173_IMCRJ-17-751-g0002_undivided_1_1.webp>). An echocardiogram detected a low ejection fraction of 40% and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The brain CT scan revealed periventricular calcifications (<PMC11338173_IMCRJ-17-751-g0003_undivided_1_1.webp>) that were properly symmetric on both sides. Additionally, there was hypodensity in the white and grey matter of both hemispheres, which was related to a loss of differentiation between them. There was no significant meningeal or parenchymal enhancement.   \nThe ophthalmoscope reveals bilateral congenital cataracts. There was also bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Initially, we began empiric intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin and cefotaxim). For the low EF of the previous echocardiography, he was given an enalapril tab and furosemide; however, we stopped after the patient's ejection fraction (EF) improved. Since birth, he has been taking phenobarbital, which was prescribed at the time of discharge. The ophthalmology department suggested an upper level clinic for the operation of the congenital cataract.\nAfter six days of clinical improvement and satisfactory oral intake, the patient was discharged home with surgical arrangements for treating congenital cataracts and Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).",

Intraocular pressures were 17 mmHg in both eyes. There was no relative afferent pupil defect bilaterally. Ocular motility was full, and there was no proptosis in either eye. The left eye was mildly displaced laterally although the patient did not complain of double vision (Figure 1(a)). Anterior segment biomicroscopic examination of the left eye revealed that the plica semilunaris and inferonasal bulbar conjunctiva had a multicystic appearance (Figure 1(b)). Anterior segment and fundus examination of the right eye were normal. There was a lesion similar to LM on the patient's left hard palate (Figure 1(c)). Anterior segment swept-source optical coherence tomography (AS-SSOCT) (DRI OCT Triton Plus, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) showed there was elevation of the plica semilunaris and bulbar conjunctiva comprising variable-sized hyporeflective spaces separated by hyperreflective tissue in the left eye (Figure 2(a)). AS-SSOCT of the right eye revealed normal findings. The patient subsequently underwent orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed an oval-shaped, intraconal mass located inferonasally in the left orbit.The orbital mass was in the same quadrant as the conjunctival LM. The mass was isointense with respect to the extraocular muscles on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and demonstrated contrast enhancement (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). There was no vascular malformation affecting the brain and meninges.\nSurgical intervention was planned to perform conjunctival biopsy and to remove the orbital tumor. Under general anesthesia, the patient first underwent subtotal excisional biopsy of the left conjunctival mass. Subsequently, an anterior orbitotomy was performed via the inferonasal transconjunctival approach and the orbital tumor was removed in toto with the help of a cryoprobe. The basal diameters of the excised reddish, smooth-edged, capsulated orbital mass were approximately 1.5 x 1.5 cm (Figure 3(a)). Histopathological examination of the orbital mass revealed enlarged vascular channels featuring thick walls with fibrosis, the lumens of which were filled with erythrocytes. The histopathological diagnosis of the orbital mass was established as VM (Figure 3(b)). Histopathological examination of the conjunctival lesion revealed a vascular structure containing lymphatic fluid surrounded by endothelium and conjunctival epithelial cells on the surface, consistent with LM (Figure 3(c)).

    "clinical_text": "A 65-year-old man visited our hospital on 6 May 2019 complaining of sensorimotor loss in two legs and bladder dysfunction for 1 day after experiencing progressive weakness and numbness in two legs for 3 months. About 4 years ago, he was diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis and unstable angina and has taken aspirin, atorvastatin, and isosorbide mononitrate daily since to reduce thrombotic cardiac risk prophylactically.\nA neurological examination found hypoesthesia below the right L1 dermatome and sensation loss below left L1. Muscle strength of left/right was grade 0/0 between L1 and L4 myotomes, 1-2/0-1 between L5 and S1. The laboratory tests were normal.\nMR examination on 2 May 2019 detected extradural protruding mass compressing the spinal cord dorsally at the T10-11 level with intramedullary hypo-intense signals on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hyperintense signals on T2-weighted images (T2WI) (Figure 1). The suspected diagnosis included ossification of LF (OLF), CLF, or subacute SSEH with incomplete paraplegia.\nSubsequent computed tomography (CT) taken on 6 May 2019 found the calcified protruding mass did not attach to the lamina (Figure 1). CLF was diagnosed with the exclusion of SSEH or OLF.\nAdministration of aspirin was replaced by low molecular weight heparin 3,000 iu injected subcutaneously per day. An intravenous drip of 0.5 g of methylprednisolone succinic acid (MP) for a single time produced temporary neurological improvement.\nThe decompression operation was postponed and performed 7 days later, on May 13, fearing intraoperative bleeding from aspirin administration above. Bilateral decompression through a unilateral approach was performed using the PPES technique under local lidocaine anesthesia with conscious sedation. A high-speed flexible diamond burr (Chongqing Xishan Technology Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China) was used to remove the inferior portion of the left lamina, the base of the spinous process, and the medial aspect of the ipsilateral inferior articular process (IAP) from T10. Then, the posterior layer of LF with its normal white-yellow color was dissected. The deeper LF layer exhibited purple-red color indicating necrotic tissue appeared, meanwhile some dark-red blood clots squeezed out through the opened window of the deeper LF layer with intermittent stale blood fluid draining out. It confirmed intraoperatively that the spinal cord was compressed by SSEH deeply and CLF superficially together. Following removal of bilateral CLF and evacuation of SSEH, the dural sac expanded to its normal elliptical contour and free mobility of the dural sac was visualized endoscopically (Figure 2). No drainage tube was left as there was no obvious bleeding at the end of decompression.\nNeurological function recovered quickly. CT re-examination on 15 May 2019 confirmed fenestration at left T10-11 interlaminar space with complete removal of CLF (Figure 3). After 1 week, the patient could walk a 10-m distance. Low molecular weight heparin doses of 3,000 iu injected subcutaneously per day were continued for another 13 days (about 2 weeks) until the discharge day. Aspirin was not restored in fear of SSEH recurrence after consultation of a cardiovascular specialist, left atorvastatin, and isosorbide mononitrate maintained. After 3 months, the patient gained complete recovery (Figure 4). MR re-examination on 26 December 2019 found complete expansion of the dura sac, while intramedullary hyperintensity on sagittal T2-weighted MR imaging sequences could still be detected (Figure 3E). A telephone follow-up on 26 November 2022 revealed normal neurological function without a cardiovascular event since.",

On gross examination, the specimen consisted of 4 ir- regular pieces of cream-gray, soft and rubbery tissue measuring 1.5x1x0.3 cm together.\nOn microscopic examination, sections from the pleural biopsy showed portions of neoplastic tissue, as well as fragments of fibrous connective tissue with mesothelium lining infiltrated by a neoplasm. The mentioned neo- plasm was composed of large cells with round to oval nuclei and a moderate amount of clear cytoplasm. Mild nuclear pleomorphism and intercellular capillary-sized vessels were two noteworthy findings (Figure.1).\nAn immunohistochemistry study revealed the following results: tumor cells were strongly positive for CD10, Carbonic anhydrase IX, EMA, Pan CK and showed negative results for CK7, CK20, NapsinA, TTF1, Calretinin, WT1, CDX2, Inhibin and PSA (Figure.2).Based on histomorphologic findings and immunohistochemi- cal results, the tumor was diagnosed to be compatible with metastatic RCC, of the clear cell type. However we advised clinical/imaging correlation for the patient. Therefore, abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) was performed, and showed a 3 cm right renal mass. Partial nephrectomy to remove the mass was performed. As suspected, the mass was of a clear cell RCC (Figure.3).",

On further history, he reported 6 weeks of generalized fatigue, 4 weeks of progressively worsening weakness and loose stools in the setting of an 18-kg weight loss over the preceding 3 months. The patient had delayed seeking medical attention due to fear of contracting COVID-19 but ultimately presented after an acute worsening of his weakness, resulting in an inability to walk up the stairs in his home. His prior to admission medications included lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin, which he had been taking for several years. The patient was a retired teacher and lived with a roommate. He consumed 3-10 alcoholic beverages a week and had quit tobacco smoking 20 years prior. Previously, he had smoked one-half pack per day. His family history was notable for rheumatoid arthritis in his father.\nOn exam, the patient's vital signs were normal and physical exams revealed a jaundiced appearance and three-fifths strength to hip flexion and extension bilaterally. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable. On initial laboratory assessment, white blood cell count was 11.9 k/mm3 (normal 4-10), total bilirubin 24.6 mg/dL (normal 0.1-1.2), direct bilirubin 13.0 mg/dL (normal 0.1-0.3 mg/dL), ALT 1053 U/L (normal <41), AST 2994 IU/L (normal 5-40), alkaline phosphatase 2893 IU/L (normal 40-129). Lipase, creatinine, and GFR were within normal limits. CK was elevated to 38,000 U/L (normal 39-308). The patient's urine sample was tea-coloured on gross inspection. Urinalysis was performed although of limited utility as the pH, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, and blood values were unable to be assessed due to interfering color. Regarding WBC and RBC counts, both returned at 0-2 (normal <2).\nGiven the elevation in CK, the patient's statin was held, and he was started on aggressive fluid resuscitation. An abdominal CT scan showed a 3 cm obstructing pancreatic head mass with diffuse pancreatic, biliary, and gallbladder dilatation. Carbohydrate 19-9 antigens returned elevated at 8,782 U/mL (reference range 0-37 u/mL). Duodenal biopsy confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Given his significant bilateral lower extremity weakness, MRI lumbar spine was done to rule out metastasis. MRI revealed diffuse edema within the paraspinal and bilateral psoas musculature with associated patchy enhancement that was thought to represent sequela of myositis. No metastatic spinal cord compression was appreciated.\nDespite early initiation of aggressive fluid resuscitation, the patient's CK continued to rise. Given concern for inflammatory myositis, on hospital day 5 the patient was initiated on prednisone 80 mg/day. On hospital day 6, following initiation of steroids, his CK value plateaued at 75,000 U/L and began declining. Creatinine and GFR remained within normal limits despite elevated CK. On hospital day 12, the patient was seen by oncology and began chemotherapy with fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin in hopes of relieving his lower extremity weakness. He remained on prednisone therapy and his CK normalized on hospital day 14. His urine appearance improved from tea-coloured to clear yellow. The patient's hip weakness was still present objectively, but subjectively he felt increased strength. He was discharged in stable condition to a skilled nursing facility and, after 3 weeks, was able to ambulate with a walker and returned home. He continued outpatient palliative chemotherapy with five total cycles of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin and then one cycle of gemcitabine and abraxane. He died about 1 month later.",

    "clinical_text": "A 4-month-old girl was brought to the emergency department with a history of lethargy, decreased feeding, and constipation for more than a month. On examination, the patient exhibited signs of moderate dehydration such as dry skin, poor skin turgor, and decreased urine output although initial vital signs were within normal limit (heart rate was 122 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 38 respiration per minute, and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg). Routine investigations performed in the emergency department identified a high corrected calcium level (5.60 mmol/L; normal range: 2.25-2.75). Upon further questioning of the parents, it became apparent that the girl had been receiving an excessive dose of vitamin D supplementation. The patient had been receiving a full 1 mL dropper of an over-the-counter vitamin D supplement (1 mL dose equal to 5000 IU) three times a day on a daily basis, for a one-month period, instead of the intended dose of three drops once per day (three drops dose equals to 400 IU). Parents are highly educated with excellent socioeconomic status; however, miscommunication with the pharmacist regarding the dosage led to this mistake. This unfortunate event led the patient to present with vitamin D intoxication, with the blood test for vitamin 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels showing a level of 350 nmol/L (critical level: >250 nmol/L).\nThe infant was admitted to a general pediatric ward for further management of calcium and vitamin D levels. She was put on intravenous (IV) fluids containing normal saline and dextrose at rate of 28 ml/hour, which equals to 150 ml/kg/day. She also received 1 mg/kg furosemide IV divided into three doses per day along with the 3-day IV course of 0.3 mg/kg methylprednisolone once daily. Furthermore, the patient was fed with low calcium formula milk (Nutricia  Kindergen).\nAs part of the routine assessment of hypercalcemia and vitamin D toxicity, various laboratory and radiological investigations were performed to assess the extent of the toxicity on the patient's renal system. Both serum creatinine and urea were normal upon admission, 32 umol/L (normal range: 11-34 umol/L) and 5.9 mmol/L (normal range: 1.8-6.4 mmol/L), respectively. Urine analysis was performed as well and showed no abnormal parameters. However, urine calcium (mmol/L) to urine creatinine (mmol/L) ratio was significantly abnormal (6.17; normal range: 0.08-0.57). Additionally, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing evidence of nephrocalcinosis (Figure 1).\nFurosemide (1 mg/kg/dose three times per day) was replaced with thiazide (1 mg/kg/dose twice per day) on day 3 of admission, and potassium citrate (1 mmol dose three times per day) was administered to reduce the risk of exacerbating the existing nephrocalcinosis.\nThe rate of reduction of the corrected calcium level was unsatisfactory, as on day 4 of admission, the level remained high at 4.17 mmol/L. At this point, bisphosphonate therapy was initiated, with two doses given (first dose of 0.5 mg/kg and second dose of 1 mg/kg).\nOn day 9 of admission, the corrected calcium level was 3.44 mmol/L, and the clinical condition of the patient had improved in terms of feeding and physical activity level. At the point of discharge after 10 days in the hospital, the patient's corrected calcium level had reduced to 2.96 mmol/L. The patient was discharged with a prescription of low calcium milk formula and potassium citrate (0.5 mmol three times per day). Furthermore, follow-up appointments with an endocrinologist and nephrologist were also given. Summary of daily laboratory results is gathered and presented in Table 1.",

No other basic diseases and family genetic history were recorded.\nAnteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the femur showed a subtrochanteric spiral fracture of the femur with proximal posterior rotation, separation, and displacement of the broken ends and angulation (<PMC10213397_fsurg-10-1172971-g001_A_1_2.webp><PMC10213397_fsurg-10-1172971-g001_B_2_2.webp>). The patient presented with tenderness and percussion pain along the longitudinal axis of the right lower extremity, as well as flexion shortening and valgus deformity of the right lower extremity. The right hip was obviously painful and swollen, and the functional activities of the right lower extremity were limited. The fractured part was similar in morphology to a \"pseudo-joint.\" The patient was positive for percussion pain on the longitudinal axis of the right lower limb. Subtrochanteric Seinsheimer type IIC fracture refers to a distal fracture of the small rotor. The two can be distinguished by x-ray and CT (Computed Tomography).\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and relevant examinations were conducted to exclude any contraindications of surgery. After reading the radiographic images, the surgeon decided to perform a minimally invasive incision treatment using a femoral reconstruction intramedullary nail with the consent of the patient and their family. After successful combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position, bed traction of the affected limb was performed, the healthy limb was placed in the lithotomy position, the perineal blocking pad was placed in the groin of the unaffected side:with buttocks of the affected side being placed are as far away as possible:the bed traction was externally rotated under C-arm fluoroscopy, and abduction, manual squeezing, lifting, and pressing were also performed to reset the broken end (three points and one line: the midpoint of the groin-knee-ankle point was positioned on a straight line, and the toes were vertically upturned). After fluoroscopic observation of the alignment, the surgical area was routinely disinfected and covered with sterile towels and a brain surgical skin film. The anatomical projection of the apex of the greater trochanter was determined by hand touch, and an incision of approximately 5 cm was made obliquely from the proximal end to the distal end to the apex of the greater trochanter. Separation forceps were used to separate the surrounding tissues, the fascia was opened longitudinally, and the apex of the greater trochanter was touched. After the needle point was determined by fluoroscopy under the C-arm machine, with the aid of the sleeve, an opener was inserted obliquely at a 45  angle in the direction of the needle to the position of the minor trochanter. After completion, the long guide needle was inserted into the distal end, and the implantation and broken end of the guide needle was observed under the C-arm machine. An electric drill was used to expand the proximal medullary cavity, and then a 6.5-mm drill bit was used to expand the distal medullary cavity. According to the condition of the patient's medullary cavity, the distal medullary cavity was increased by 1 mm. Under the C-arm machine, the intramedullary needle implantation and broken ends were seen by fluoroscopy, and two locking nails were implanted along the distal end of the guide. The intramedullary needle was knocked back to shorten the separation between the broken ends, and the proximal double half-threaded screw was driven along the guide according to the perspective of the C-arm machine, which was satisfactory. After satisfactory surgery, rinse, suture, and bandage the wound. Remove the anesthesia tube and return to the ward.\nAfter the operation, antibiotic treatment was given for 48 h, and intervention treatment for anti-osteoporosis and promoting fracture healing was performed. The patient could stay in bed for 14 days and perform simple standing activities with the aid of an auxiliary device. One month after surgery, simple walking activities could be performed with the aid of an auxiliary device. After three months of surgery, the patient could gradually disengage from the auxiliary tool for autonomous activities. During this period, the patient avoided sitting for a long time to prevent nail peeling during nail cutting. The patient was instructed to undergo a routine X-ray examination at two month after surgery to assess fracture healing, hip joint morphology, and implant status. The patient and their family members did not undergo routine medical examinations as instructed. After two months of surgery, the patient consciously contacted the foreign body in the hip to receive reexamination.",

    "description": "25-year-old man with steroid-resistant Tolosa-Hunt syndrome successfully treated with a single infusion of infliximab, achieving complete steroid withdrawal and sustained remission.",
    "clinical_text": "We describe a 25-year-old man who presented with a 6-month history of persistent, daily, severe, retro-orbital and left-sided hemicranial headache that was associated with persistent numbness of the left forehead and decreased pinprick sensation over that region. He exhibited partial left-third nerve palsy expressed as partial ptosis of the left eye, weakness of the left inferior oblique and medial rectus, and diplopia on right lateral gaze. There was no proptosis, and a fundus examination produced normal findings. He had a normal pupillary reflex. The other findings of the neurological examination were normal.\nMRI of the brain and orbits revealed a discrete abnormally enhanced signal in the left cavernous sinus. The findings of blood and CSF studies were normal, including for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. His chest X-ray was normal. The lesion was too small to perform a biopsy. The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) was based on the unilateral headache, preceding paresis of the ipsilateral cranial nerves, granulomatous enhanced lesion in the cavernous sinus on MRI imaging, and absence of other clinical or radiographic signs or symptoms fulfilling the International Classification of Headache Disorders.\nThe patient was started on prednisone at 60 mg daily, which controlled his symptoms. However, reducing the dose to below 50 mg resulted in the immediate recurrence of headache and diplopia. The patient was therefore maintained on 50 mg daily, but developed cushingoid features, acne, leg edema, and hyperglycemia. Tapering the dose by 10 mg per month resulted in symptom relapse after the second or third month. The patient was then infused with 300 mg of infliximab over 2 hours. The pain subsided the following day followed by resolution of the ophthalmoplegia. The numbness in the forehead decreased but did not subside completely. It was possible to taper the steroids completely without any relapse of his symptoms even at an 8-month follow-up. The patient did not experience any side effects of infliximab, and was asymptomatic on follow-up without requiring another dose.\nTHS is an idiopathic disorder characterized by subacute, severe, persistent, orbital and retro-orbital pain together with ophthalmoplegia. It is associated with the presence of granulation tissue in the anterior cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure. It usually responds to steroid therapy with good control of the symptoms. Nevertheless, there are occasional cases of THS that do not respond adequately to steroids or that require prolonged, high-dose treatment that produces serious side effects. Other therapies that have been applied to control this condition include methotrexate, mycophenylate mofetil, and radiotherapy, but these interventions also have side effects.\nInfliximab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody that induces proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase reactants, enhances leukocyte migration, and activates neutrophils and eosinophils. It is used to treat inflammatory conditions including orbital inflammatory diseases, and was reported to successfully control the symptoms in a patient with THS resistant to steroid therapy. It is administered intravenously at a dose of 3-5 mg/kg per infusion.\nIn rare conditions infliximab can cause mild headache and fatigue, low-grade fever, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and slight elevations in liver-function tests.\nThe dramatic and persistent improvement in the symptoms in the present case along with the patient being able to stop steroids completely raises the issue of whether infliximab should be added early when treating patients with steroid-resistant THS. Furthermore, our patient required only a single infusion to control his symptoms even with a prolonged follow-up, in contrast to the first case reported who received four infusions, which suggests that a controlled study should be performed to standardize the use of infliximab in THS, rather than copying the regimen used in other inflammatory disorders.",

When she awakened at night she noticed that the weakness had progressed and that she had lost control of bladder function. On admission, she also complained of acute severe pain on the thorax, paresthesias and weakness of the right leg, and she reported diffuse pain in the left leg. In the weeks previous to presentation she had been experiencing a different sensation on the left side of her thorax. Clinical exam revealed an atactic paresis of the left leg graded 4/5 on the MRC scale. Tendon reflexes were pathologically increased in the lower limbs, and Babinski's response was absent. There was a loss of superficial sensation below the T6 dermatome, most pronounced on the left side, and there was diminished sense of vibration, touch and position in the left leg. Her sphincter pressure was decreased, and there was 150 mL residue after micturition.\nSpinal MRI showed a calcified Th8-9disc herniation which slightly indented the anterior cord without cord abnormalities (Figure 1). The paresis progressed to grade 1 of the left leg and grade 2 of the right leg within two hours. Emergency laminectomy of the eighth thoracic vertebra was performed that same night. Due to rapid deterioration no further (time-consuming) diagnostic procedures (eg additional imaging) were carried out prior to surgery. The partly calcified disc was removed through a transpedicular approach until there was no more spinal cord compression. Surgery was uneventful. Of note, because of the emergency setting, intra-operative neuromonitoring was not available. The day after surgery the paresis improved slightly, and there was no further deterioration of neurological function. Repeat MRI performed the day after surgery demonstrated multiple hyperintense intramedullary lesions (Figure 1). Therefore, acute myelitis (possibly neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease, NMOSD) was considered as a differential diagnosis, and treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated, followed by oral maintenance dose. Repeat MRI 10 days after symptom onset revealed a clearly demarcated T2 hyperintense lesion in the posterior cord extending from the fifth to the tenth thoracic vertebrae, with partial contrast enhancement (Figure 1). Cranial MRI was normal.\nThe results of additional laboratory exams including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, vitamin B12, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Serology for CMV, EBV, Lyme, and Treponema pallidum and thyroperoxidase, thyroglobulin, antinuclear, anti-extractable nuclear antigen, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, lupus anticoagulant, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and paraneoplastic antibodies were within normal limits or negative. Visual evoked potentials showed delayed latencies (p100: left 120 ms, right 122 ms). The last-mentioned finding led to a possible diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and the patient was started on azathioprine for long-term immunosuppression. However, repeat ophthalmologic exam revealed no abnormalities, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal cell count, mild elevation of protein levels and no oligoclonal bands. Therefore the azathioprine was discontinued. At this point, the patient was referred for a second opinion, and spinal cord ischemia was established as the most likely diagnosis.\nThe patient was transferred to the division of rehabilitation. After three months the patient was able to walk short distances with a walker. MRI showed a marked decrease in cord abnormalities, and contrast enhancement was no longer present (Figure 1).

    "clinical_text": "66-years-old male.\nA sudden onset of the right hemiplegia and dysarthria.\nNothing significant.\nSmoked 30 cigarettes/day for 45 years.\nAt 7:30 a.m. while driving, the patient suddenly experienced right hemiplegia and dysarthria and was rushed to our hospital.\nRight facial paralysis, dysarthria, right upper extremity paralysis, right upper and lower extremity paresthesia, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 6/42.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed slightly high signal areas in the left putamen, corona radiata, and part of the middle cerebral artery region. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g001_a_1_4.webp><PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g001_b_2_4.webp>]. The T2-weighted images showed no obvious thrombi in the occluded area.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital at 8:25 a.m. Based on the MRI findings, we determined that there was a mismatch between the perfusion area of the left middle cerebral artery and the high signal DWI lesion. An intravenous alteplase therapy was deemed appropriate without any cautionary or contraindicated items as per the guidelines. Alteplase was administered at 9:27 a.m. following the management of hypotension with nicardipine. The primary strategy was to pursue an endovascular recanalization.\nA 9 Fr sheath was placed in the right femoral artery, and a 9 Fr OPTIMO (Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan) was guided into the left internal carotid artery. Internal carotid arteriography revealed that the left middle cerebral artery was distally occluded [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g001_c_3_4.webp>]. In the delayed phase, an anastomosis of the cerebral pia mater provided the collateral blood flow from the anterior to the middle cerebral arteries [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g001_d_4_4.webp>]. The rebar (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was guided distal to the occlusion with a CHIKAI 14 200 cm (Asahi Intec, Aichi, Japan) to secure the distal vessel, and a Trevo XP ProVue Retriever 4.0 x 30 mm (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was deployed. The post deployment imaging showed an immediate flow restoration but poor stent dilation in the occluded area, suggestive of arterial stenosis [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g002_a_1_3.webp>].\nThe proximal and distal diameters of the stenosis were 2.6 mm and 2.1 mm, respectively [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g002_b_2_3.webp>]. After retrieving the Trevo, a 1-min amount of thrombus was retrieved. Although reperfusion was achieved, a significant degree of stenosis persisted [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g002_c_3_3.webp>]. A diagnosis of ICAD was established, and an angioplasty using a balloon catheter was proposed.\nCrushed aspirin and clopidogrel (300 mg each) were administered orally. A 6 Fr Cerulean catheter DD6 113 cm (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) was guided to the pyramidal segment of the internal carotid artery as a distal access catheter. Subsequently, a Gateway 2.0 x 12 mm monorail (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) was placed at the stenosis region using a CHIKAI. A gradual dilatation and retraction were performed under nominal pressure [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g003_a_1_3.webp>]. Subsequent imaging revealed a temporary recanalization [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g003_b_2_3.webp>]; however, restenosis was observed after 7 min [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g003_c_3_3.webp>].\nThe strategy was to use a coronary perfusion balloon for prolonged angioplasty while maintaining the peripheral perfusion. Ryusei 2.5 x 20 mm monorail (Kaneka Medix, Osaka, Japan) was navigated toward the stenotic lesion. After dilating to 2 atm, the wire was drawn anterior to the proximal perfusion hole, and the perfusion lumen was subsequently unsealed [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g004_a_1_4.webp>].\nThe angiography performed in this state showed that peripheral perfusion was achieved using balloon dilation [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g004_b_2_4.webp><PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g004_c_3_4.webp>]. The patient was maintained in this state for 15 min, during which intermittent angiography was performed to monitor the patency of the perfusion lumen. Ozagrel sodium 80 mg was administered intravenously. The Ryusei was then deflated and adequate vascular dilation was observed [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g004_d_4_4.webp>]. After an additional waiting period of 20 min, we confirmed the absence of restenosis and concluded the procedure.\nHeparin was administered while monitoring activated clotting time (ACT) during the procedure, with a minimum ACT value of 200. The total dose was 6,000 units.\nThe patient's symptoms resolved to an NIHSS score of 0 on the day after the procedure. Postoperative echocardiography and electrocardiography revealed no evidence of cardiogenic cerebral embolism. Based on the intraoperative findings, the patient was diagnosed with ICAD. Postoperatively, aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg prescriptions were continued, and cilostazol 200 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg were added. Postoperative MRI showed a clearly defined high signal DWI without significant enlargement of the infarcted area [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g005_a_1_3.webp>] and although a mild stenosis remained, the MRA also showed a satisfactory peripheral perfusion [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g005_b_2_3.webp>].\nThe patient was discharged without a neurological deficit on the 7th day.\nClopidogrel medication was discontinued at discharge. Three months later, the MRA indicated an improvement in the stenosis [<PMC10629293_SNI-14-365-g005_c_3_3.webp>], and the patient was prescribed antithrombotic therapy with cilostazol as a single agent. No specific events were observed for more than 1 year after the procedure.\nAn application for an unapproved new medical device was submitted to the hospital's committee for the evaluation of highly difficult new medical technology, and approval was obtained. Furthermore, during patient consultations regarding surgical procedures, we explicitly conveyed that we may employ nonconforming medical devices if adequate substitutions proved arduous and secured informed consent accordingly.",

    "clinical_text": "A 22-year-old woman (married, gravida 0, para 0) presented to our department with cessation of menstruation for 73 days and slight vaginal bleeding for 4 days. She reported no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or bloating. Physical examination revealed a small amount of blood in the vagina and an abnormally enlarged, soft uterus. The serum beta-hCG was 582,621 mIU/ml. Transabdominal ultrasound showed the uterus was 10.4 x 11.0 x 7.7 cm, with an uneven echo area of 8.7 x 6.6 cm in the uterine cavity, which looked like falling snow. The patient underwent suction and curettage, and a pathological examination revealed a complete hydatidiform mole. A week later, an ultrasound examination suggested a residual lesion in the uterine cavity (2 x 1.5 cm), and the beta-hCG was 8,407 mIU/ml. Subsequently, she underwent a second suction and curettage, and the beta-hCG level further decreased to 5,718 mIU/ml ( Figure 1 ). The results of the second pathological examination were consistent with those of the first ( Figure 2 ).\nThe patient was then recommended weekly beta-hCG assessments for surveillance. However, she did not comply with the follow-up schedule. Within 21 days after the second molar evacuation, her serum beta-hCG level was elevated to 183,309 mIU/ml, despite an unremarkable ultrasonography examination. She didn't take the high hCG level seriously so that she forgot to consult doctor in time. After that, the beta-hCG level continued to rise, reaching 489,190 mIU/ml on day 39 after the second procedure. An ultrasonography examination showed that the uterus was 9.2 x 8.9 x 7.8 cm in size, an uneven echo area of 6.9 x 5.2 cm was near the fundus of the uterine cavity, the convex anterior wall had lost its normal muscle layer, and the outer margin was about 0.24 cm from the serosal layer ( Figure 3A ). Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an enlarged uterus with multiple cystic mixed abnormal signals in the left anterior wall. The lesion was about 7.1 x 6.1 x 8.2 cm, extending from the muscular layer to the serosal layer ( Figure 4 ). The patient was diagnosed with an invasive mole. Chest and cranial CT scans were performed, and no metastatic lesions were detected. These findings indicated an invasive mole at stage I according to the FIGO 2000, with a World Health Organization (WHO) score of 6, and belonged to the low-risk GTN.\nThe patient was very young and had the willing to perserve her fertility, and we proposed methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy. The day before the planned chemotherapy, she experienced sudden abdominal pain accompanied by shortness of breath, blood pressure of 76/48 mmHg, and a pulse rate of 116 bpm. An emergency abdominal ultrasound scan showed acute intra-abdominal bleeding (approximately 2,000 ml) ( Figures 3B-D ), and blood tests showed a hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 g/dL. We recommended emergency surgery, but she rejected. Given she was experiencing an acute intra-abdominal bleeding which risked her life, then we chose to perform the MTX chemical therapy and uterine artery embolization simultaneously which can suppress the tumor and stop bleeding at the same time, and is a relative conventional way to stop bleeding in a short time. So uterine artery embolization was performed, and 35 mg of MTX was administered bilaterally through the uterine arteries. Simultaneously, four units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) were transfused. The next day, the serum beta-hCG decreased to 83,530 mIU/ml, and the hemoglobin concentration was 8.2 g/dL. Four units of packed RBCs were transfused again. There were no signs of persistent intraperitoneal bleeding, and the patient was stable. Seven days later, chemotherapy with etoposide, methotrexate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine (EMACO) was administered. After the first cycle, the serum beta-hCG dropped to 894.2 mIU/ml and was normalized after cycle five. Consider the cost and the severe side effects such as myelosuppression, vomiting, hair loss and so on. We decided to use the MTX regimen with 1mg/kg/day intramuscularly on days 1, 3, 5, 7, with folinic acid 0.1 mg/kg/day orally 24 hours after MTX on days 2,4,6,8); repeat every 2 weeks. The patient received two additional courses of chemotherapy with MTX to reduce the risk of relapse. At the 13-month follow-up after therapy completion, the patient was disease free with negative beta-hCG.\nInvasive mole is a form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) that most commonly occurs after the evacuation of a molar pregnancy. Most cases are clinically rather than histologically diagnosed.\nDiagnostic methods: The diagnostic criteria for GTN after hydatidiform mole were as follows: The elevated blood beta-hCG level reached a plateau ( +- 10%) for 4 times (day 1, 7, 14, 21), lasting for 3 weeks or longer; The serum beta-hCG level increased (>10%) for 3 consecutive times (day 1, 7, 14) for 2 weeks or longer; The histological diagnosis was invasive hydatidiform mole.\nDiagnostic challenges: It is necessary to exclude residual pregnancy (any retained molar tissue/products of conception after suction and curettage) and repeat pregnancy during diagnosis. If it cannot be excluded, it is recommended to repeat suction and curettage, and if necessary, hysteroscopy can be performed.\nDiagnosis (including other diagnoses considered): The patient was diagnosed with an invasive mole. Chest and cranial CT scans were performed, and no metastatic lesions were detected. These findings indicated an invasive mole at stage I according to the FIGO 2000, with a World Health Organization (WHO) score of 6.\nPrognostic characteristics when applicable: beta-hCG is a reliable indicator of tumor activity. At the 13-month follow-up after therapy completion, the patient was disease free with negative beta-hCG.",

During the laryngoscopy, a 1.5x2.0cm tumor was identified in the area of the left arytenoids. The laryngeal inlet was hidden beneath the protruding tumor, but the upper esophageal sphincter was free from the tumor. The upper parapharynx wall of the left vocal cord was protruding toward the pharyngeal cavity (<PMC3551692_1752-1947-7-15-1_A_1_3.webp><PMC3551692_1752-1947-7-15-1_B_2_3.webp><PMC3551692_1752-1947-7-15-1_C_3_3.webp>). The left vocal cord was fixed. The patient had no previous medical or family history except for hypertension. No enlarged lymph nodes were found in the neck during palpation. The remainder of the physical examination, which included ophthalmologic and dermatologic tests, was also negative. \nComputed tomography (CT) revealed a non-enhancing mass arising from the left side of the arytenoid cartilage and from the parapharynx and extending to the areas of the carotid artery (Figure 2). On closer examination of the axial view from the CT image, we were able to observe a mass in the arytenoid cartilage and a mass in the parapharynx existing separately without any linkage at the second cervical section. We suspected a neurogenic tumor originating from the left vagus nerve and superior laryngeal nerve based on the results. Therefore, we planned to remove the mass in the parapharynx with the lateral pharyngotomy approach, in order to excise the mass both in the neck and larynx at the same time, and then advance toward the larynx to remove the mass in the arytenoids. Using the lateral pharyngotomy approach, we found that the cervical mass was 3.5x5.0cm in size with a yellowish color and an ovoid shape. The mass was adherent to the surrounding tissue, resulting in a difficult excision that required removal of tissue surrounding the tumor as well as the tumor itself. We were able to determine that it was a neurogenic tumor due to its linkage to nerves in both the upward and downward directions.\nWe then examined the mass closely, but it did not connect to the larynx. Thus, we used the lateral pharyngotomy approach for the removal of the parapharynx tumor, and removed the arytenoid tumor using a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. The size of the larynx tumor was 2.0x1.3cm and it enclosed the arytenoids.\nThe histological stain was positive for S-100, and an examination revealed soft tissue with multiple nerve fascicles, some of which were enlarged with edematous endoneurium with intermixed collagen and bipolar cells consistent with a diagnosis of plexiform neurofibroma; however, the arytenoid mass was confirmed as a simple neurofibroma (Figure 3).\nAfter the pathologic examination, we suspected VRD. In consequence, a close examination was performed but no specific findings were present. The patient complained of a voice disorder postoperatively, and left vocal cord palsy was present on physical examination. We waited and monitored the situation, but the patient showed no improvement; therefore, we conducted an injection laryngoplasty postoperatively, after which the vocal disorder and airway aspiration improved.\nTwo months later, a direct laryngoscopy showed no tumor growth. To date, two years postoperatively, the patient has had neither respiratory nor feeding difficulties, and her voice is nearly normal (<PMC3551692_1752-1947-7-15-4_A_1_2.webp><PMC3551692_1752-1947-7-15-4_B_2_2.webp>).",

BGC Canada managers were responsible for participating in trainings and managing their own club's design and delivery of BBL.\nThe researchers were responsible for developing evaluation tools, training staff on how to use the tools, assisting clubs with collecting data during on-site visits, analyzing and communicating these data, and soliciting staff feedback regarding the feasibility of evaluation activities in practice. The program was to be carried out over 4 subsequent years, including 2 years of piloting across three clubs with ongoing adaptation. Evaluation findings from pilot and adaptation stages would inform the expansion to 10 clubs in the final 2 years. Use of a train-the-trainer model would help build and maintain project sustainability beyond grant duration.\nThe pilot stage involved implementing the BBL training with three BGC Canada clubs, who then went on to design and deliver their first seasons of BBL:with the leadership team's close monitoring, evaluation, and ongoing support, as per their established roles in the planning stage. In alignment with the KTAC phase assess barriers and facilitators to knowledge use, this BBL stage focused on exploring the successes and challenges that arose in the pilot. Given that multiple KTAC phases can be an undergone concurrently, three sub-phases were also carried out: select, tailor, and implement an intervention, monitor knowledge use, and evaluate outcomes. A multi-faceted, sport-based, trauma-sensitive practice training intervention was designed for staff to learn how to develop BBL programs at their home clubs. Twelve staff participants (three managers, three supervisors, six coaches) across three clubs, were gathered to attend an initial 3-day intensive workshop.\nThe workshop was primarily facilitated by the consultants, with the support and participation of the researchers and BGC Canada administrators. The topics broadly covered: (a) psychoeducation of the prevalence and impact of trauma on the child, (b) factors that contribute to trauma healing in sport, (c) strategies to intervene with members in times of dysregulation, (d) strategies for coaching and re-designing sport to facilitate resilience-building, (e) strategies to facilitate members' skill development. The topics were further adapted in subsequent iterations of the training workshop during the BBL's adaptation stage (see Table 1 for list of workshop modules). The facilitators used delivery strategies such as brief lectures, story sharing, paired and group discussions, active games and sports, coaching practice, role play activities, and workbook activities. Staff received a guidebook as a resource to use post-workshop as they returned to their home clubs to implement BBL. Staff gathered again at 4- and 12-months into programming to attend refresher workshops (2-days each). An online social learning space was established via Slack, where the leadership team and participating clubs shared experiences, resources, strategies, media, and questions with one another throughout the project, in effort to ease access to communications, resources, and learning opportunities.\nDuring program implementation, each club aimed to recruit 20-25 members (ages 9 to 12) per season. The goal was for each club to run three seasons a year, with each season building on the relationships and skill development of the previous season. Members were welcome to participate in multiple seasons. Clubs could choose season length (6-10 weeks), the sport (e.g., basketball, soccer, ball hockey), and session frequency (all clubs chose 1/week). All clubs were responsible for structuring sessions around a universal BBL workout structure, comprised of seven intentional components (see Table 2 for complete details): (a) arrival, (b) warm-up, (c) skill play, (d) transition time, (e) cool down, (f) team time, and (g) departure. This structure offered a predictable schedule of activities, in which members could experience safety, skill-building opportunities, and practice regulating themselves in competitive, real stakes environments (Bergholz et al.,).\nStaff were trained on several techniques to proactively facilitate members' regulation (e.g., practicing deep breathing to help calm emotions, allowing unlimited timeouts to rest when feeling overwhelmed, and structuring a space [The Zone] to enter, self-regulate, and return to main activities when ready). Staff also adopted a 4-step framework to connect with members in times of dysregulation: (a) stabilize:support member in a triggered state to re-regulate and arrive to a place where they can have a conversation, (b) explore:facilitate a judgment-free inquiry about what the member is experiencing, (c) plan:co-construct strategies to resolve what happened and to regulate better in the future, and (d) return:co-construct strategies to transition back to the activities on the member's own will.\nThe program also focused on teaching three BBL skills tied to resilience-building (see Table 2): (a) come to play (e.g., preparation, self-awareness), (b) build my team (e.g., empathy, seeking support), and (c) play on (e.g., effort, recovery). Strategies to facilitate these BBL skills included defining skills out loud, having a 'skill of the week', posters with skills and definitions, encouraging and praising skill use, and reflecting on skills during team time (Bean et al.,). These skills were constructed based on evidence of what works in trauma-sensitive sport programming (Edgework Consulting,), understandings of life skill development through sport (Holt et al.,), and BGC Canada core values (BGC Canada,). See Supplement 1 for strategies on facilitating BBL skills within the BBL Workout Structure.\nIn evaluating the program, three questions were proposed: (a) how did staff perceive their training experiences and what value was generated from these experiences? (b) what were the successes and challenges that staff met in implementing their training into practice? and (c) what was the impact of programs on members? A mixed-methods approach was used to address these questions. To explore staff's training experiences, knowledge surveys and interviews were conducted pre- and post-training, and field notes, pictures, and audio-recordings were taken during training. To monitor successes and challenges, staff completed structured logbooks after each BBL session, participated in multiple focus groups and interviews, and shared conversations on Slack. To examine program impact, members completed surveys on well-being (Tennant et al.,), resilience-related skills (Windle et al.,), and basic needs support (Bean, Rocchi, et al.,; Bean, Sewell, et al.,). Members also took part in interviews and arts-based activities, and staff completed report cards of members' participation (Shaikh et al.).\nEvaluation results related to staff's training experiences revealed that many desired outcomes were reached, including high satisfaction and usefulness of the training workshop for staff, building staff's BBL-related knowledge and skills, and staff's use of trauma-sensitive practices in the BBL and into their everyday lives (Shaikh et al.,; Shaikh, Bergholz, et al.,). Several facilitators to knowledge use were identified: (a) staff's existing experiences with trauma-exposed members in BGC Canada helped ease adoption of sport-based trauma-sensitive practice, (b) staff found the training workshops highly engaging, useful, applicable, and valuable; (c) staff perceived that training content aligned with what they experienced in practice, (d) ongoing meetings with consultants facilitated continuous learning for staff, and (e) the pilot allowed room for trial and error, which eased staff's apprehensions in applying a novel program and practice (Shaikh et al.,; Shaikh, Bergholz, et al.,; Shaikh, Forneris, et al.,).\nDespite these facilitators, clubs reported several challenges (i.e., Shaikh, Bergholz, et al.,) that were consistent with research in community programs (Forneris et al.,; Larson et al.,). A major difficulty was in recruiting and retaining children (e.g., scheduling difficulties, building value for the BBL, competition with other programs, referral-recruitment versus open-to-all recruitment. Inconsistent attendance made it difficult for staff to maintain an engaging experience where members can foster positive peer connections. Staff also found it challenging to balance the demands of a structured program with the myriad of children's behavioral issues (e.g., outbursts, disengagement, aggression), given that BGC Canada staff:and members:are most familiar with unstructured, free play opportunities. As well, clubs encountered staff turnover:an inevitable reality of youth-serving organizations where many staff are part-time or in transition phases of their careers:which led to loss of capacity, especially when staff were BBL trained.\nConsistent relationships are primary protective factor in supporting trauma healing (NCTSN,). A benefit of having BBL managers and supervisors attend training was their capacity to step in when staff were absent. This strategy worked well given that the BBL members were also BGC Canada members who attended other programs within the club. Thus, members interacted with supervisors and managers on a regular basis beyond BBL:contributing to consistency in mentorship. Evaluation results related to program impact revealed improvements in outcomes, albeit non-significant; here, perceived well-being trended upward from pre-post season, and members who attended > 80% sessions reported higher basic psychological needs support (Shaikh & Forneris,). Qualitative data analysis revealed that the members reported feeling accepted, having improved friendships, and developing sport and life skills (Shaikh & Forneris,). These positive learning experiences suggested some initial effectiveness of the BBL. Overall, these evaluation findings informed BBL adaptations in the next stage.\nConcurrently with the pilot stage, the adaptation stage was informed by the combination of ongoing leadership team meetings, consultations and check-ins with each club, and evaluation results. The KTAC phase of adapt knowledge to the local context was re-visited, using insights of barriers and facilitators to knowledge use to inform ongoing BBL project development; adapting BBL processes at the organizational-level and club-level. These adaptations were communicated through email, bi-monthly meetings, Slack, and refresher training workshops. The major adaptations included: (a) tailoring the training intervention, (b) supporting staff's motivations and accounting for staff turnover, (c) enhancing recruitment strategies, and (d) transition of training responsibilities to master trainers.\nThe leadership team worked together to develop 12 BGC Canada-adapted modules, covering how to build staff's awareness and value for sport-based trauma-sensitive practice, and how to structure and design a BBL program (see Table 1). These modules were the foundational structure for the training workshop and the development of BBL resources (i.e., the coach guidebook, operating manual, training manual). To address the challenges that staff encountered in intervening with dysregulated members, more focus was added to strategies for managing groups and helping members return to a stabilized state.\nAt the organizational level, the leadership team established bi-monthly check-ins with all pilot clubs together. This strategy offered additional mentorship and oversight to the staff, building morale, shared understanding, and value for BBL (Ika & Donnelly,), and enabled staff to share experiences and learn from each other. At the club level, managers were encouraged to: (a) choose trainee candidates that were full-time staff and planned to invest in the club long-term; (b) supervise at least half of staff's BBL sessions and provide them feedback to help monitor, support, and enhance the quality of their BBLs; and (c) have other staff sit in on BBL sessions to observe, participate, learn, and eventually transition into BBL when faced with staff turnover.\nAt the organizational level, customizable promotional materials were created (i.e., posters, infographics) with BBL branding for clubs to use in their marketing. To enhance recruitment, all clubs were encouraged to remove limits to BBL membership and invite all children to participate regardless of pre-identified risk status. This strategy helped maximize reach and inclusiveness to unscreened trauma-exposed children.\nTo promote the self-sustaining capacity of the BBL, a train-the-trainer model was used to train BGC Canada managers and other key staff to become BBL master trainers (Shaikh, Bean, et al.,). To carry this out, an intensive training workshop was facilitated by the leadership team, in which BGC Canada managers learned and delivered the 12 BGC Canada-adapted BBL training modules to their peers and received feedback to improve their delivery. Following the workshop, these newly trained master trainers returned to their home clubs to plan the delivery of BBL training workshops to their staff. These workshops were also observed by leadership team members, who provided feedback. The master trainers were then expected to be help train newly onboarded staff in the expanded rollout.\nThe expansion involved rolling out, monitoring, and evaluating the adapted training intervention and BBL programs in ten additional clubs across Canada. Three KTAC phases of select, tailor, and implementing interventions, monitor knowledge use, and evaluate outcomes were undergone (again). Here, the master trainers carried out the training intervention as an intensive, in-person workshop to 20 staff, covering the 12 BGC Canada-adapted training modules. The leadership team supported master trainers in communicating expectations, coordinating travel and logistics for clubs, and modifying evaluation tools. The newly trained staff went on to deliver programs at their home clubs, while continuing to receive support from master trainers (e.g., bi-monthly calls), and the leadership team (e.g., via Slack, email, and on-site visits). The same evaluation questions were used to monitor BBL training and program implementation, using a slightly modified mixed-methods approach. For instance, items on knowledge assessments and logbooks were matched to the adapted training modules, and the length and wording of member's surveys were simplified.\nEach club ran one season (~ 6-10 weeks); the second season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, evaluation is still ongoing, as clubs offer either in-person, physically distanced program delivery, or virtual delivery. However, initial outcomes of the BBL expansion have indicated that: (a) the training intervention was successful in improving knowledge and attitudes of participating staff in sport-based trauma-sensitive practice; (b) the training intervention was perceived as enjoyable and useful for staff; (c) in most clubs, recruitment of members successfully reached 20-25 + members; however, at least two clubs were well under this mark; (d) having trained staff is essential for running high-quality BBL programs; yet, with staff turnover, clubs without trained staff resorted to traditional practices of youth engagement in sport, resulting in loss of trauma-sensitive practice. Thus, there is a need for incorporating alternative sustainability practices within BGC Canada to maintain BBL quality during and beyond grant duration.\nThe sustainability stage involves initiatives put in place to continue BBL beyond grant- end, in alignment with the sustain outcomes phase of KTAC. The first goal in this plan was to maintain and expand the BBL (as a sport-based trauma-sensitive practice program) to more clubs across Canada. A second, broader goal was to build staff's capacities in trauma-sensitive practices across BGC Canada clubs and programs, beyond sport. This second goal was constructed based on advocacy from BBL staff of the value of trauma-sensitive practices and their applicability in club work outside the BBL, as well as interest from additional clubhouses in building their club's trauma-sensitive capacity. Several processes will contribute to reaching these two goals: (a) using a train-the-trainer model, (b) developing context-specific resources, (c) expanding to reach Canadian newcomers, (d) transitioning to a virtual platform in COVID-19.\nUsing a train-the-trainer model helped build the organization's ownership of the program, promoting internal sustainability (Shaikh, Bean, et al.,; Whitley et al.,). Here, BBL managers who delivered BBL in the pilot were offered training to develop into master trainers and went on to facilitate BBL training for staff within and beyond their clubs. Clubs with access to master trainers were then able to host sport-based trauma-sensitive practice as a core part of their club's training. Master trainers also train staff at a national level, whether through facilitating training workshops or consultations with newly onboarded BBL clubs.\nDeveloping context-specific knowledge products was important for communicating knowledge in clear and user-friendly ways, which can facilitate continued use of knowledge in practice (Holt et al.,). Materials were created that can be shared and used universally across the clubs, including the coach guidebook, training manual, promotional materials, and evaluation activities. As well, evaluation findings were shared throughout the project through user-friendly media (i.e., presentations, reports, infographics, and posters). Blogging was used as an effective means of disseminating knowledge beyond academic audiences (Stoneham & Kite,); here, the leadership team published a blog on strategies for integrating trauma-sensitive practices into play (Shaikh et al.. The authors also shared their experiences on integrating evaluation activities within community organizations along with effectives strategies for sport stakeholders to build evaluation capacity (Shaikh et al.).\nGiven the importance of funding in maintaining relationships and capacity building (Coppola & McHugh,), various means of extending BBL funding have been explored. BGC Canada secured funding to extend BBL across five additional clubs to target Canadian newcomer populations. Direct support for newcomers is needed as they may face unique traumatic exposure; refugees from conflict regions can face loss, grief, family separation, mental health disorders, and migratory stressors (Ley & Mario,). In this expansion, an advisory group was created with BBL managers to share and co-construct strategies for meeting newcomer needs and integrating equity, diversity, and inclusion principles in BBL design, recruitment, and practice. Development of BBL for newcomers is currently underway. This extension has taken on a unique look post-pandemic, where clubs have had to shift their BBL programs to virtual and physically distanced settings.\nTo effectively meet BBL staff's needs in the pandemic, staff perspectives were sought through virtual meetings and a needs assessment survey. Staff largely requested more training in trauma-sensitive practices, support to shift BBL virtually, and strategies to facilitate small group, in-person activities. Thus, the leadership team delivered virtual training for staff during Summer 2020, which covered refreshers of BBL content and strategies to facilitate virtual BBL. All clubs then transitioned to a modified BBL in Fall 2020 (i.e., physically-distanced in-person or virtually). Monitoring and evaluation are currently ongoing, to gain insights of successes and challenges of facilitating BBL in a COVID world.\nThe abrupt shift, the need for trauma-sensitive practices across clubs in Canada, and the success in adapting the BBL based on changing conditions, made it ideal for the leadership team to pursue further options for project scale-out (Ika & Donnelly,). Thus, funding was secured to develop virtual trauma-sensitive training for scale-out to BGC Canada's 775 clubs nationally. Here, the KTAC will be re-cycled as a second iteration. The problem identified was the need for integrating trauma-sensitive practices across all BGC Canada clubs; the selected knowledge was the BGC Canada-adapted trauma-sensitive practice modules and program materials; this knowledge will be adapted from in-person to virtual via BGC Canada's virtual e-learning platform; and this training will be implemented to ten BGC Canada clubs, reaching ~ 150 staff.\nThe strength of the BBL partnership has led to many successes and effective responses to challenges in the BBL development process. Three lessons are shared that were most pertinent to advancing KT processes in BGC Canada. These lessons may be considered by sport, community, and recreation groups when integrating trauma-sensitive practices for effective project development: (a) meaningful change starts with small steps, (b) maintain ongoing two-way communication with stakeholders, and (c) integrate-with rather than add-on to existing activities.\nThe leadership team avoided using an all-at-once approach in both the training and implementation to ease integration and prevent overburdening staff (Bromley et al.,). Instead, a developmental approach was taken, involving short, intensive training workshops and ongoing consultations over a long period of time. This approach enabled more time for staff skill-building (i.e., BBL design and delivery) and learning through trial and error (an oft-preferred source of learning in sport; Walker et al.,). The ongoing consultations helped monitor skill development and generate insights on high impact behaviors:staff skills used to generate effective results. High impact behaviors are not necessarily known from the outset:their effectiveness will depend on the staff's characteristics, the demands of the context, and the member's needs (Larson et al.,). Thus, it was worth investing time in the design and pilot process to determine these high impact behaviors and prioritize them in project development. For instance, a high impact behavior in BBL was integrating BBL skills (e.g., naming and defining skills, using skills in informal conversations, integrating a \"skill of the week\").\nWhen staff integrated BBL skills, members were more likely to understand and internalize the skills. While effectiveness of explicit life skill teaching is supported in youth sport research (Bean et al.,), the developmental approach used in BBL was necessary to explore what these behaviors looked like, under what conditions do they manifest, and how effective they were (Holt et al.,). Then, these skills were emphasized in further training and communications (e.g., sharing strategies), and in evaluation (e.g., logbooks included a space for staff to describe how they embedded BBL skills).\nIt was beneficial to engage BGC Canada stakeholders (i.e., program managers, club staff) from the outset, and communicate using easy channels of access (i.e., regular phone/video meetings, consultations with specific clubs, emails, and Slack). This ongoing communication aligned with the project's CBPR approach and was conducive to relationship building between the leadership team, stakeholders, and their peers (Coppola & McHugh,). Such relationship building can contribute to synergies between groups and build stakeholders' value for the project and its future (Schinke et al.,). Stakeholder input (e.g., feedback) and insights (e.g., club-specific successes and challenges) were also gathered in-depth through ongoing evaluation activities (e.g., interviews, focus groups, logbooks). These findings were valuable in actively supporting adaptations to existing programs, as opposed to exclusively at the end of the grant period (Brush et al.,). As well, open communication helped identify which clubs needed extra support and intervene with them (e.g., if clubs faced challenges in recruitment, planning activities for a wide age-range of members or integrating evaluation within a fixed time schedule).\nGiven the multi-faceted nature of staff's work within a community program context (Newman et al.,), it was important to work within the existing capacities of clubs and staff, rather than starting from scratch. For example, several clubs found it challenging to create an entirely new BBL (e.g., recruitment of members and staff, scheduling) and found that adapting an existing sport program to BBL was more feasible. Moreover, evaluation activities were developed and adapted through trial and error of what works. This process revealed that the act of doing evaluation was beneficial for participants.\nWith staff, logbooks were used to report session-by-session experiences, which brought insights into program fidelity; the logbooks also mutually benefitted staff in reflecting on the program session together:by discussing successes and challenges and setting goals for the next session. With members, quantitative pre-post surveys were used:which members found unengaging. Thus, evaluation was shifted to more creative, engaging, and participatory activities (e.g., drawing, storytelling) that could be integrated within existing programming (Shaikh et al.). These activities enabled participants to share their experiences:which mutually benefitted the program and members in applying BBL skills (e.g., applying come to play by being willing to share, applying build my team when giving praise to another member; Jacquez et al.,).",
